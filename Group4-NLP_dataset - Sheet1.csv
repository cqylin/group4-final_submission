10.1007/s11042-023-17926-x,zhao,2024,"To construct effective prediction models for hypertension in diabetic patients based on machine learning. This study used electronic data from 2080 diabetic patients attending the specialized outpatient clinic for metabolic diseases of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from March 2017 to July 2020. We adopted 5 machine learning algorithms (artificial neural network, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, Bayesian network) and constructed hypertension risk prediction models based on patients’ non-invasive variables. The study showed that artificial neural network (ANN) performed best, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver curve in the test set were 92.47%, 92.98%, 92.02%, 0.951, respectively. The prediction model showed that the top three predictors and their weight values were systolic blood pressure (w=0.3346), age (w=0.1437) and diastolic blood pressure (w=0.1236). Factors of daily living such as education level, activity, heart rate and fish intake also showed importance. ANN can apply non-invasive data to well predict the risk of secondary hypertension in diabetic patients. Healthcare providers could use this model to rapidly screen high-risk patients and instruct them to monitor blood pressure regularly and maintain a healthy lifestyle, thereby reducing the risk of hypertension in diabetic patients. The  model is more suitable for areas with high morbidity of hypertension and poor socioeconomic conditions. It has important implications for achieving health management in a larger target population, in line with the international mission to improve the global burden of hypertension.","Diabetes and hypertension are the two most common chronic diseases in the world, and their incidences are increasing [1]. Not only incidence of primary hypertension is high, but also incidence of secondary hypertension, the most common complication of diabetic patients, is increasing year by year. More than 50% of patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes will eventually have high blood pressure [2]. In addition, management of hypertension, including its diagnosis, treatment, and control, can result in significant medical costs. In the United States, people with diabetes spend $4,434 a year on medical expenses related to high blood pressure, much more than people without diabetes [3].

The most threaten of death in diabetic patients is cardiovascular disease, that is mostly induced by hypertension. One study showed that regardless of whether it was type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, patients with diabetes-related kidney disease usually had hypertension [2]. Once a patient developed high blood pressure, his nephropathy would accelerate the progression, and further aggravates diabetes [2]. The two diseases are very closely related and interact with each other. Diabetes and high blood pressure can also cause similiar complications, mainly referring to microvascular and macrovascular diseases, including stroke, chronic kidney disease and eye disease, etc. This forms a vicious circle, which increases the suffering and disease burden of patients. In diabetic patients with hypertension, incidence of complications is significantly higher than that in non-hypertensive diabetic patients. A study pointed out that for every 10 mmHg increased in systolic blood pressure in diabetic patients, then the risk of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke increased by 1.29 times and 1.56 times, respectively [4].

Several pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between diabetes and hypertension, such as the up-regulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, oxidative stress, inflammation, and activation of the immune system [5]. Vascular dysfunction and injury caused by hypertension are important mechanisms for diabetes-related vascular complications. In addition, diabetes and hypertension share similar pathological alterations, such as endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, arterial remodeling, atherosclerosis, and dyslipidemia [5]. These pathogenesis and pathology make diabetes and hypertension inextricably linked, and show dynamic changes in their effects.

Diabetics' self-management includes active control of blood glucose levels and lifestyle changes to prevent hypertension. Studies pointed out that healthy lifestyles, including high-quality diet, non-smoking, moderate physical exercise and moderate drinking, were related to reducing incidence of hypertension [6, 7]. In addition to lifestyle, obesity and family history were also important risk factors affecting hypertension [8]. In this regard, it is essential to develop practical and accurate risk prediction models to help healthcare providers identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension. The highest-risk individuals in the population will be targeted for subsequent lifestyle interventions or medication to prevent them from progressing from a high-risk status to actual hypertension, and thereby delay or prevent the development of other complications.

More and more studies focus on occurrence and outcome prediction of hypertension. At present, methods of constructing hypertension prediction models mainly focus on the application of logistic regression, Cox regression, Weibull regression, and machine learning models. Du et al. used logistic regression to analyze the sociodemographic characteristics and health-related behaviors of population in Inner Mongolia of China to predict hypertension [9]. The results showed that the model could predict self-reported hypertension well. Wu et al. used machine learning methods to predict prognosis of young patients with hypertension and compared its performance with methods commonly used in clinical practice [10]. The results showed that this model had a comparable predictive value with Cox regression. Carson et al. used Weibull regression to construct a predictive model to assess short-term risk of hypertension. The results indicated that the model may be a useful tool for identifying young people at high risk of hypertension [11]. Ye et al. predicted onset factors of essential hypertension in Maine patients, noting that factors such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular diseases, mental diseases, clinical utilization indicators, and socioeconomic determinants were related to the development of essential hypertension [12]. A systematic review summarized 15 high-quality hypertension prediction models, and compared studies' design and model performance [13]. The area under the receiver curve (AUC) of these models ranged from 0.71 to 0.81, which can well distinguish the hypertension level. However, most of them were based on traditional prediction methods, such as cox regression or logistic regression, and relatively few traditional risk factors (< 15). For processing a large number of data, machine learning can show greater advantages and stability [14]. Besides, several studies had shown that machine learning was superior to traditional risk prediction models in predicting cardiovascular events. The study by Du et al. showed that the ensemble method XG-Boost achieved high performance (AUC = 0.943) in predicting 3-year coronary heart disease incidence on an independent test dataset. Comparative analysis showed that nonlinear models (K-nearest neighbor AUC = 0.908, random forest AUC = 0.938) outperformed linear models (logistic regression AUC = 0.865) on the same dataset, and machine learning methods significantly outperformed traditional risk scales or fixed models (eg, Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Model) [9]. Another research showed that machine learning algorithms were better at correctly predicting the absolute number of cardiovascular disease cases than existing CVD risk prediction tools (such as ACC/AHA, QRISK2, Framingham, Reynolds), while successfully excluding non-cases [3]. This had been demonstrated in large and heterogeneous primary care patient populations using routinely collected electronic health data. Machine learning can significantly improve the accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction, increasing the number of patients who can benefit from preventive treatment, while avoiding unnecessary treatment for others. Therefore, this study included a variety of machine learning models, and compared them to select the optimal model for predicting secondary hypertension, which would be more helpful for healthcare staff to choose the appropriate model, increase clinical work efficiency and improve prediction accuracy.

There have been a few studies on the level of hypertension in diabetic patients. A study from Kuwait used four methods (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, multi-factor dimensionality reduction and support vector machine) to predict the occurrence of hypertension in a data set of 8421 diabetics [15]. The results showed that support vector machine had the best performance. The study was based on a small amount of non-invasive data (age, BMI and family history for diabetes, ect.) for prediction, and did not include factors such as lifestyle habits. Another latest study, using a data set of 2747 type 2 diabetes patients, constructed a hypertension risk scoring system by Cox risk regression [16]. The risk scoring system predicted that the AUC of hypertension within 1 year could reach 0.74. However, the study did not include variables such as daily diet in detail. Most of these models were developed using data from mostly white participants and were less effective when applied to the Chinese diabetic population due to ethnic differences in the incidence of hypertension. Previous studies, mostly based on laboratory data, required invasive tests on patients, which were costly and increased patient suffering. Fewer of these studies involved diet, exercise and other related content, and medical personnel could not refer to clinical intervention studies. The Chinese diabetic population is huge, and the dietary structure (high-calorie, high-fat, more refined foods), lifestyle (reduced physical labor and exercise), socioeconomic level, pathogenesis, types of obesity, and ethnic characteristics are different from those of the diabetic population in Western countries. At present, there is no prediction model for secondary hypertension in diabetic patients specifically developed for Chinese people. Therefore, it is particularly important to establish predictive models for hypertension in Chinese diabetic patients.

The study aimed to establish machine learning-based prediction models for secondary hypertension in diabetic patients and identify predictors associated with secondary hypertension, laying the foundation for subsequent studies on patients with secondary hypertension in diabetic patients. It is hoped that new method will eventually predict the likelihood of developing secondary hypertension with improving performance in diabetics. Early warning of those at risk of hypertension, medical staff can formulate targeted interventions based on patients' own conditions to reduce incidence of hypertension and benefit more diabetics.","In this study, hypertension risk prediction models for diabetic patients were constructed based on electronic data of the metabolic disease specialist clinic in China. Among 5 models built (artificial neural network, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, Bayesian network), artificial neural network model showed good predictive performance. The results showed that the model successfully realized prediction of hypertension in diabetic patients, and the model could target those at high risk for subsequent prevention management. That is, in the future, we can identify high-risk groups by collecting population, disease information, daily living conditions and physical parameters of community members and inputting them into the artificial neural network model. It not only provides a new solution for disease risk prediction, but also lays a research foundation for early screening and evaluation of secondary hypertension high risk groups in diabetic patients.

Artificial neural network is rapidly evolving type of machine learning algorithm in recent years. It is based on a large-scale synergistic processing mechanism that can mimic the processing capabilities of human brain and nervous system. This study combines boosting algorithm to improve the model accuracy. It has proved to be more adept at predicting performance. Fig. S6 shows the most basic neural network model structure. The operation process of the boosting based artificial neural network prediction model in this study is shown in Fig. S7. Compared with traditional logistic regression, COX regression and other methods, artificial neural network are less susceptible to sample size and have more stable performance.

The accuracy of the artificial neural network in the training and test sets was 91.56% and 92.47%, respectively, and other performances were also satisfactory. The model not only considered the generally accepted and available risk factors, but also precisely measured them to ensure their acceptability in clinical practice. The AUC of artificial neural network in this study was higher than that of Lin et al. [16], which may be related to the fact that this study was based on ANN combined boosting algorithm in machine learning algorithm. In addition, 21 influencing factors were included in this study, and many living status factors were added in the study, more than in the study of Lin et al. Farran et al. 's support vector machine based a five-fold cross-validation predicted hypertension in a Kuwaiti diabetic population with an AUC as high as 87.4% ± 1.1% [15]. In this study, the AUC of the training set and test set for the support vector machine were 0.912 and 0.908 respectively, which was similar to the study by Farran et al. Dinh et al. [21] classified cardiovascular diseases based on a tenfold cross-validated random forest with an AUC of 0.829, which was slightly lower than the AUC (0.916) of the random forest based test set in this study. Wan et al. [22] applied a decision tree to predict cardiovascular classification in patients with diabetes with an AUC of only 0.677, which was still a gap from the 0.841 in this study. Heo et al. [23] predicted essential hypertension in male and female populations with AUC values of 0.732 and 0.833, respectively. At present, there are few studies on the prediction of secondary hypertension based on Bayesian network, and the research on secondary hypertension based on Bayesian network remains to be continued.

Artificial neural network provides a powerful set of methods. When there are a large number of variables in the research, artificial neural network is one of the best methods to predict disease. This study included 21 non-invasive variables that can quickly screen high-risk groups of hypertension. The results showed that systolic blood pressure, age and diastolic blood pressure were the top three predictors of hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension increased with age, and coexistence of diabetes and hypertension was the highest among the elderly [24]. A study pointed out that with age, the structure and function of arteries, renal function, sympathetic nervous system activity, and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activity had undergone significant changes [25]. Changes in these pathophysiological factors promoted the increasement in blood pressure. In aging countries and regions, special attention should be paid to the prevention and management of senile hypertension.

Some factors also play an important role in predicting risk of hypertension in patients. Waistline, BMI and hipline were also important factors affecting blood pressure and closely related to indicators of obesity. Studies had shown that obesity was not only related to diabetes [26], but also closely related to blood pressure [27]. In particular, suffering from abdominal obesity greatly increased risk of hypertension [28]. Patients with family history of hypertension were significantly more likely to develop hypertension [29]. In addition, this study noted that family history was independent of obesity, smoking and other modifiable risk factors [29]. The present study suggested that family history of hypertension was also an important influencing factor for secondary hypertension. Work status had also been shown to be an important risk factor for hypertension. We speculated that this was mainly related to intensity of activity and the resulting stress under different conditions.

In addition, type of diabetes was important predictors of hypertension. We speculated that this was related to the difference in the average age of onset of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and the degree of obesity. The study showed that type 2 diabetes had an important relationship with obesity and insulin resistance [30]. Type 1 diabetes mainly occurs in children, and type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in adulthood [31, 32]. Smoking has been recognized as a factor related to high blood pressure [33]. This study showed that smoking was also an important factor in predicting hypertension, which was consistent with previous research results. Smoking increased oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions and damaged vascular endothelial cells, which can trigger arteriosclerosis. These responses eventually led to the occurrence of hypertension. Another study pointed out that smoking was strongly associated with other complications of diabetes, such as nephropathy and retinopathy [34]. Therefore, the promotion of smoking cessation programs is of great significance to diabetics' health management.

We also observed some dietary activity variables, such as activity, fish intake, salt intake, intake of vegetables and fruits, intake of bean products, and sleeping, which were very useful in detecting high blood pressure in our model. Chinese cooking methods and eating habits are heavy oil and heavy salt, which is different from the West. Although the Chinese dietary structure has been greatly adjusted in recent years, compared with the intake of carbohydrates in Western countries, Chinese people eat more staple food and relatively less fat and protein intake [35]. This may be an important factor of diabetes complicated with hypertension in China. This suggests that diabetic patients not only need diabetes-related diets in their daily lives, but also pay attention to intake of diets related to high blood pressure and appropriate activities, which will is beneficial to delay occurrence of high blood pressure [36]. However, it is very difficult for diabetic patients to face and maintain changes in their lifestyles [37]. During regular health education, healthcare staff need to convey importance of dietary adjustments to health and formulate corresponding diet plans for patients.

Hypertension is a multifactorial disease, and the relationship between factors is complicated. Targeted research that integrates non-invasive factors such as demographic information, disease information, physical parameters, daily life conditions to predict hypertension in diabetic patients was not widespread in the Chinese population. Most of the previous studies were based on biochemical factors that required patients to pay for the examination in the hospital [38, 39]. The innovative point of this research is that it was based on easily measured vital signs, lifestyle and other factors, which is suitable for regular screening of diabetic patients living in the community for a long time. And most of the previous studies were based on one or two methods to predict hypertension, which was more limited and single [40]. In this study, 5 machine learning methods were selected and their performances were compared. The model with the best performance was selected as the prediction model of this study. It was another innovative point of this research to fully consider the predictive performance of different models and select the most suitable model for predicting hypertension in patients with diabetes.

Research on patients with hypertension and diabetes had been focused on chronic diseases. Machine learning methods had good performance in cardiovascular disease [38]. The newly constructed artificial neural network model in this study can be used in future clinical work to rapidly screen the risk of hypertension in diabetic patients, enabling them to control their blood pressure according to their own risk level. For diabetics, regular prediction of hypertension can help patients to increase their vigilance. For those at high risk, lifestyle or medication changes can be used to prevent the disease and reduce its pain. In the future, the tool could also be optimized as an online assessment tool so that patients regularly assess the risk of hypertension at home. Risk prediction models are important and cost-effective for preventing hypertension, especially in remote areas with limited resources in China [39].

However, this study also had some limitations. First, the data came from only one region of China. Patients and risk factors may differ in different regions. In future studies, we will expand sample size and collect data from different regions to improve performance of the prediction model. Second, external validation was not performed in this study, which may be possible in further future studies.

10.3390/diagnostics12081967,jeong,2022,"Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are major chronic diseases that are important factors in the management of cardiovascular disease. In order to prevent the occurrence of chronic diseases, proper health management through periodic health check-ups is necessary. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus according to the health check-up, and to develop a predictive model for hypertension and diabetes according to the health check-up. We used the National Health Insurance Corporation database of Korea and checked whether hypertension or diabetes occurred from that date according to the number of health check-ups over the past 10 years. Compared to those who underwent five health check-ups, those who participated in the first screening had hypertension (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 2.14-2.22), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.30-1.35) and both diseases (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.39-2.53); individuals who underwent 10 screenings had hypertension (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.83-0.88), diabetes mellitus (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.81-0.85) and both diseases (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.79-0.87). Individuals who attended fewer than five screenings compared with individuals who attended five or more screenings had hypertension (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.59-1.62; AUC = 0.66), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.20-1.22; AUC = 0.59) and both diseases (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.72-1.78, AUC = 0.63). The machine learning-based prediction model using XGBoost showed higher performance in all datasets than the conventional logistic regression model in predicting hypertension (accuracy, 0.828 vs. 0.628; F1-score, 0.800 vs. 0.633; AUC, 828 vs. 0.630), diabetes mellitus (accuracy, 0.707 vs. 0.575; F1-score, 0.663 vs. 0.576; AUC, 0.710 vs. 0.575) and both diseases (accuracy, 0.950 vs. 0.612; F1-score, 0.950 vs. 0.614; AUC, 0.952 vs. 0.612). It was found that health check-up had a great influence on the occurrence of hypertension and diabetes, and screening frequency was more important than other factors in the variable importances.","High blood pressure and diabetes are major modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death globally [1]. In rapidly aging societies, greater burden from CVD is expected, making the control and management of these modifiable risk factors especially important [2]. Research indicates that while the prevalence of high blood pressure has decreased over the past few decades, especially among high-income Western and Asia Pacific countries, global mean blood pressure levels have remained virtually unchanged [3]. Moreover, the prevalence of diabetes has been on the rise: although increases have been relatively gradual in the European region, several countries have recorded drastic increases in prevalence, especially in the Oceania region [4]. In Korea, the age-standardized prevalence of hypertension among Korean adults over the years 2001 to 2011 did not rise over 24% and was lowest in 2007 at 19.7%. Meanwhile, trends of increasing prevalence for diabetes and impaired fasting glucose were recorded among Korean adults aged 30 years or older, with a diabetes prevalence of 9.9% in 2007–2009. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes both increased with age [5].

Studies in the literature suggest a need for more stringent management for uncontrolled risk factors related with CVD [5,6,7]. Currently, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends yearly screening for hypertension among high-risk individuals and adults 40 years and older and less frequent screening for younger adults with low risk [8]. Overweight or obese adults of ages 35 to 70 years are also recommended to receive regular screening for diabetes [9]. In Korea, all adults older than 19 years are eligible for general health screening every 2 years via the National Health Screening Program, which from 2009 began to focus on reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases via health risk assessment and lifestyle modification [10,11]. The program consists of seven categories, including history taking and measurements of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, hemoglobin, glucose, lipids, liver function, and renal function. In 2009, 63.3% of about 16 million people who were eligible for the general health screening participated [12]. Participation rates have climbed steadily since, reaching 72.3% in 2014 and 74.1% in 2019.

Several studies have examined the relationship between health check-up participation and cardiovascular risk factors [13,14,15], finding that receiving health test interventions are associated with lowered risk scores and better life expectancy [15], lower risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events [14], and lower prevalence of several diseases, including metabolic syndrome [13], and that screening interval can affect health outcomes [16,17]. Meanwhile, however, some studies have indicated that screening participation has no effect on changes in disease prevalence in comparison to only receiving usual care [18]. Nevertheless, there is not yet enough data on whether the frequency of participation in optional health examinations can affect cardiometabolic risk factors, and few longitudinal studies have explored the effects of health examinations over an expansive time frame.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the relationship between screening frequency and new incidences of hypertension and diabetes utilizing national screening data collected over a 10-year period. We also set out to build a model based on these findings that can accurately predict the incidence of hypertension and diabetes.
","Previous studies on the impact of participation in health screening programs have offered varying results. One randomized trial reported that health test participation was associated with reduced cardiovascular risk score [15], while another showed that population screening increased the detection of CVD risk factors, such as hypertension [25]. General screening has been shown to be associated with increased detection of chronic disease in several other studies [14,18,26,27,28,29,30]. A review article also reported that general health checks were associated with increased detection and treatment of chronic diseases, but had little impact on mortality or cardiovascular event reductions [31]. However, these results remain controversial as other studies have reported that health check participation is associated with fewer cardiovascular risk factors [13], risk factor value reductions [32], and mortality reductions [33]. Additional studies have been conducted to identify social elements that can affect participation, such as perceived susceptibility and health knowledge [34,35], socioeconomic status [36,37], medical history [38,39,40,41], health behavior factors, and sociodemographic factors [42,43]. Despite the above reasons, there have not been many studies on chronic disease prediction models according to health check-ups, so it is necessary to confirm new facts using large-scale data.

A hypothesis that the incidences of hypertension and diabetes would differ in two groups divided according to the number of health examinations could be established due to the lack of studies on the relationship between health check-ups and chronic diseases and the fact that a lot of information was available in the NHIS data. However, since an accurate verification method was needed to prove our hypothesis, we applied two research methods: confirmatory and exploratory. In order to conduct a confirmatory study, age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, which may act as confounding variables, were examined to evaluate the hypothesis. In logistic regression analysis to compare the incidences of hypertension and diabetes according to the two groups, age and sex, as well as the number of health examinations, were adjusted, and sensitivity analysis was used to increase the reliability of the results. In order to proceed with the exploratory study, a classification model was developed using various variables, and the importance of the top five variables among the variables used in the model was extracted to confirm the relationships between the variables used in our studies.

There are many previous studies that predict diabetes or hypertension. People with a family history of diabetes are known to have a higher risk of diabetes than people without a family history of diabetes [44]; most of the family history variables are used in the diabetes predictive model [45,46]. However, family history variables were not considered in our study for the following reasons. Since the main purpose of this study is to explore whether or not health check-ups have a significant effect on the occurrence of chronic diseases, the predictive model requires a large number of subjects. Using family history of diabetes as a variable in the NHIS data has the disadvantage of a significant decrease in subjects (Table S3). However, if it is simply for the above reasons, there may be a prejudice that it is to show that the results of our study are good. Therefore, logistic regression analysis was performed, and there was no difference between the results of adding a family history of diabetes and the results obtained in the study, AUC, and odds ratio (Tables S4 and S5). The results of logistic regression analysis confirmed that the probability of high blood pressure and diabetes decreased as the number of health examinations increased. Similar results have been observed in previous studies [14,15,18,26,27,28,29,30]. Upon extracting the importance of the variables used in the analyses and the variables used in the modeling, we confirmed that the number of health examinations and age were the most important variables in several models.

In terms of general health screening, the Korean government has not only continued expanding the eligible population and facilitating participation but has also implemented policies to ensure improvements in quality, equity, and result management in the national health screening program [47]. One of these policies is the third comprehensive National Health Screening Program plan [48], which was announced in 2021. In this, the government planned to promote self-health management by providing more in-depth information on individual health screening results, regional screening center locations, and reservation notifications through mobile applications. Other laws are also in place to encourage follow-up hospital visits after general check-ups, subsidizing medical expenses incurred by examinations for definite diagnosis in people who have taken national health examinations [49]. Such efforts of the Korean government and the medical community have led to a rise in health screening follow-up management rates from 6.0% in 2008 to 13.9% in 2018 [50].

The results of this study showed that an increased participation in health screening was significantly related to the lowered occurrence of hypertension and diabetes. This suggests that encouraging the general population to participate diligently in health screenings may be an important factor to preventing disease and improving public health. Previous studies on the impact of screening on future health-related behaviors support this claim [51,52], stating that receiving the screening results may be a teachable moment for the participants, which then can lead to a change in lifestyle factors. In Korea, 76.9% of the insured population and 41.9% of recipients of medical care assistance participated in the 2018 national health check-up [53,54]. While these participation rates cover most of the population, there remain people who do not receive adequate screening for whichever reason. Therefore, it is important that national health check-ups be publicized and made easily accessible to all persons eligible for participation, regardless of socio-economic status or location. Encouraging health check-ups using the result and model from our study is a simple step that will help prevent chronic disease and will also help achieve the health goals set by the government.

There are some limitations to this study that should be taken into consideration. First is the possibility of self-selection bias, as it is entirely up to the individual to choose whether they participated in the screening program. Since we do not know the reasons for non-participation, the results of this study should be approached with caution. Second is the possibility of response bias in the self-report part of the screening program. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the results of health screening participation. Finally, in order to know how much predictive power depends on the number of health check-ups, a predictive model was constructed using logistic regression and machine learning technique. Better performance results could be obtained with using deep learning methods, such as long short-term memory and recurrent neural networks which can use risk factors that affect outcomes over time [46]."
10.3389/fcvm.2022.839379,islam,2022,"Background: Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in South Asia. Machine learning (ML) models have been shown to outperform clinical risk predictions compared to statistical methods, but studies using ML to predict hypertension at the population level are lacking. This study used ML approaches in a dataset of three South Asian countries to predict hypertension and its associated factors and compared the model's performances.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using ML analyses to detect hypertension using population-based surveys. We created a single dataset by harmonizing individual-level data from the most recent nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey in Bangladesh, Nepal, and India. The variables included blood pressure (BP), sociodemographic and economic factors, height, weight, hemoglobin, and random blood glucose. Hypertension was defined based on JNC-7 criteria. We applied six common ML-based classifiers: decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), logistic regression (LR), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to predict hypertension and its risk factors.

Results: Of the 8,18,603 participants, 82,748 (10.11%) had hypertension. ML models showed that significant factors for hypertension were age and BMI. Ever measured BP, education, taking medicine to lower BP, and doctor's perception of high BP was also significant but comparatively lower than age and BMI. XGBoost, GBM, LR, and LDA showed the highest accuracy score of 90%, RF and DT achieved 89 and 83%, respectively, to predict hypertension. DT achieved the precision value of 91%, and the rest performed with 90%. XGBoost, GBM, LR, and LDA achieved a recall value of 100%, RF scored 99%, and DT scored 90%. In F1-score, XGBoost, GBM, LR, and LDA scored 95%, while RF scored 94%, and DT scored 90%. All the algorithms performed with good and small log loss values <6%.

Conclusion: ML models performed well to predict hypertension and its associated factors in South Asians. When employed on an open-source platform, these models are scalable to millions of people and might help individuals self-screen for hypertension at an early stage. Future studies incorporating biochemical markers are needed to improve the ML algorithms and evaluate them in real life.","Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease attributing to 8.5 million deaths globally, with 88% deaths in low-income and middle-income countries (1, 2). In South Asia, the prevalence of hypertension has been increasing primarily due to increased access to unhealthy foods, sedentary lifestyles, and rural-urban migration (3, 4). South Asia also has the lowest rates of hypertension detection, treatment, and control, with little improvement in these outcomes over the past three decades (2). Many people with hypertension remain largely undetected in South Asia due to decreased screening awareness among the general population (5). Hypertension can lead to coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, and premature mortality (6), which are mostly preventable through low-cost medications and timely interventions.

Several factors contribute to this higher prevalence of hypertension in South Asia, including physical inactivity, decreased awareness, smoking, unhealthy diet, access to healthcare, cost of medications (5, 7–9). However, most of the studies lacked population representativeness, had a small sample size, and used a wide range of tools to measure risk factors. Several risk prediction models have been successfully used to identify and stratify patients according to their risk factors and initiate preventative therapies, for example, Framingham Risk Score for predicting coronary heart disease (10) and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Calculator (11). However, these models have several limitations, including non-representative populations, inadequate ethnic diversity, selected endpoints, and poor reliability (11). There is a need to develop population-specific risk prediction models for people in South Asia.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have been shown to outperform traditional statistical approaches in developing risk stratification tools for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (12–15). ML is a branch of computer science that broadly enables computers to “learn” without being directly programmed (13) and process large data with complex interactions. Although ML algorithms are not based on causal inference compared to traditional statistical methods, it is still a critical approach to estimating causal effects in observational studies. ML often shows superior performance compared to traditional ststistical techniques for reducing bias, automatic managing of missing variables with less manipulation of original data, controlling for confounding and data balancing- a key factor that leads to improved results (13). ML provides accuracy values, for example, 85% accuracy for a model suggest that the algorithm correctly identified 85 out of 100 participants which can aid in decision making. In addition, ML techniques excel in analyzing “big data” problems where commonly used statistical approaches struggle. Thus, ML methodologies can help develop automated tools for disease prediction, decision-aids, and identifying likely rates of hypertension in a population (13).

A recent review identified and examined ML techniques in hypertension detection and reported a a lack of studies combining sociodemographic and clinical data with signal processing which could increase model performance (16). A previous study used ML algorithms for automatic classification of hypertension using personal features but failed to include sociodemographic data (17). Another study in India developed ML risk stratification algorithms for diabetes and hypertension using data from 2,278 patients collected by community health workers (18). Two studies in China used ML to detect hypertension using electronic health records (19, 20). Despite the advancement in ML models for individual risk prediction for different diseases, no studies have used ML models to predict hypertension at a population level and validated the models using large datasets in South Asian countries. We, therefore, aimed to use ML approaches to identify factors associated with hypertension diagnosis and compared the model's performances to predict hypertension in three South Asian countries.","To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply ML approaches to predict hypertension and its associated factors using population-representative data in three South Asia countries. We identified seven risk factors associated with hypertension in the South Asian population: age, BMI, education, wealth status, ever measuring BP, being diagnosed by a doctor, and taking medication to lower BP. After applying ML algorithms, we observed that XGBoost, GBM, LR, and LDA had the highest accuracy and recall with a score of 90 and 100%, respectively. DT achieved the highest precision value of 91%. ML models are superior to traditional statistical techniques where complex relationships between variables may not be fully explained using standard statistics. Our work has implications for hypertension prevention by applying these ML models to population-level data for hypertension screening among the population and automating the tasks without substantial human labor.

Several recent studies have proposed ML models to predict hypertension using a variety of demographic, biomarker, fitness, and spirometry data in various combinations (26–28). Ture et al. used age, gender, smoking, lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels and evaluated the performance of three three decision trees, four statistical algorithms, and two neural networks on 694 participants (29). Radial Basis Function showed the best performance for sensitivity (95.24%), specificity (66.67%), and predictive rate (81.48%). Similarly, Heo and colleagues developed hypertension prediction ML models using obesity, biomarkers, and spirometry data. They identified that obesity indices were most closely related to the risk of developing hypertension where wrapper-based feature selection methods-LR model showed the best performance (sensitivity and specificity of 0.813 and 0.401, respectively (30). A study in Canada using medical records and demographics used a neural network model for predicting hypertension with about 82% accuracy (26).

Several recent studies have demonstrated that ML models might be feasible and valuable for predicting and managing hypertension (27, 31). However, despite the growing interest, ML-informed BP prediction is yet to be implemented in clinical practice due to limitations such as lack of ML algorithms, consistency, accuracy, and reliability (31). Recently, a study in Korea utilized three different classification methods, namely LG, LDA, and classification and regression tree for hypertension risk prediction using an extensive database. All three methods performed reasonably well, with LR only marginally better with 58% accuracy (32). A similar study applied ML algorithms on patients with hypertension using 12-year longitudinal data from a nationwide cohort with 55 variables, where RF showed the best performance (F1-score = 0.772) in terms of generalization to detect high-risk patients (33).

Our study found BMI to be a good predictor of hypertension. Previous studies have shown obesity is strongly related to the risk of developing hypertension (34–36). Studies in the United States, China, and India have shown that BMI is a risk factor for hypertension (37–39), whereas waist circumference is correlated with cardiovascular diseases (34, 38). Another study in China using ML identified high education, sedentary job, a positive family history, overweight, physical activity, and unhealthy diets as risk factors for hypertension (40). A prospective cohort of 33,000 people from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh reported a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension among urban-dwelling, higher education, and higher wealth index participants (41). We found a significant association of hypertension with BMI, wealth status, and education in the South Asian population. These disparities might be due to lack of access to healthcare facilities, poor BP screening, recording, reporting, lack of awareness regarding risk factors, and inappropriate treatment (42, 43).

Several mathematical techniques and ML models have been used to develop risk prediction models in healthcare (44, 45). Ture and colleagues' used DTs, statistical algorithms, and neural networks and identified that neural networks have the best predictive ability for hypertension using risk factors as inputs (30). However, a limitation to this study was the missing obesity data which is known to be associated with hypertension (29). Heo and colleagues also developed hypertension prediction models using DT, LR, and NB classifiers using obesity, biomarkers, and spirometry indices as variables in creating these models. An important limitation of this study is the lack of data on wealth index, education levels, smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity (30). We utilized non-invasive data to develop ML models to predict hypertension in the South Asian population. Previous studies in South Asia have shown the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mobile phones and digital technologies (46–50). However, there is a need for demographic representativeness in training data, model transparency and standardized frameworks for using these ML prediction models to improve representativeness and reproducibility (51).

The following limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, a limited number of variables are included in the models. Data on risk factors such as family history, race, alcohol consumption, waist-hip ratio, physical activity levels, dietary intake, and biochemical parameters (e.g., blood glucose, lipid profile) were unavailable for all countries, which might have affected the measurement precision of our models. Second, the risk factors may have changed since some study data were from the 2016 survey. Third, ML models have an inherent weakness in making claims about causation. Finally, we could not externally validate our models using other data sources from these countries. Therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution. Despite these limitations, the primary strength of this study is the use of large-scale nationally representative survey data from 3 South Asian countries using ML approaches to predict hypertension.

Future research on developing country-specific risk assessment tools and validation are essential since risk factors, particularly demographics, education level, and wealth index, are not the same among different countries. These models can also be made available online or via mobile phone applications where individuals can check their risks of developing hypertension at home by answering simple questions such as their age, BMI, and sex. Models based on robust biochemical data, electronic health records (52) and external validation are recommended in the future A two-stage approach can be put into clinical practice, where ML model identifies individuals who are at risk of hypertension and in the second stage, at-risk individuals undergo evaluation by a physician for a confirmed diagnosis and appropriate treatment (53)."
10.1371/journal.pone.0289613,islam,2023,"Background and objectives: Hypertension (HTN), a major global health concern, is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, premature death and disability, worldwide. It is important to develop an automated system to diagnose HTN at an early stage. Therefore, this study devised a machine learning (ML) system for predicting patients with the risk of developing HTN in Ethiopia.

Materials and methods: The HTN data was taken from Ethiopia, which included 612 respondents with 27 factors. We employed Boruta-based feature selection method to identify the important risk factors of HTN. The four well-known models [logistics regression, artificial neural network, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)] were developed to predict HTN patients on the training set using the selected risk factors. The performances of the models were evaluated by accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) on the testing set. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is one of the explainable artificial intelligences (XAI) methods, was used to investigate the associated predictive risk factors of HTN.

Results: The overall prevalence of HTN patients is 21.2%. This study showed that XGB-based model was the most appropriate model for predicting patients with the risk of HTN and achieved the accuracy of 88.81%, precision of 89.62%, recall of 97.04%, F1-score of 93.18%, and AUC of 0. 894. The XBG with SHAP analysis reveal that age, weight, fat, income, body mass index, diabetes mulitas, salt, history of HTN, drinking, and smoking were the associated risk factors of developing HTN.

Conclusions: The proposed framework provides an effective tool for accurately predicting individuals in Ethiopia who are at risk for developing HTN at an early stage and may help with early prevention and individualized treatment.","Hypertension (HTN), defined as the elevated blood pressure beyond its normal ranges, is a major public health concern with its raising prevalence and effect among the adults’ overtime worldwide [1–3]. It is one of the most common serious chronic non-communicable diseases. Hypertensive people are affected by different types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), e.g., coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, aortic disease, myocardial infarction [4–7], which are the leading cause of disability, morbidity and mortality that increase the economic burden of out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPE) [8–10]. As reported by World Health Organization (WHO), worldwide around 9.4 million people were died due to HTN every year [10]. According to Belay et al., [2022], globally the prevalence of HTN was 26% in 2000 and it was projected to reach around 1.56 billion (29.2%) by 2025 [11]. The latest estimation by WHO in 2021 revealed that about one-third (31.1%) of the world’s adult population had HTN (1.39 billion); of whom 2/3 were from in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) [12]. Also, a systematic analysis of population-based studies from 90 countries, including Ethiopia estimated that HTN among adults was more prevalent in LMICs (31.5%) than the high-income countries (28.5%) [13]. Different epidemiological studies in Ethiopia reported that the prevalence of HTN was ranging from 7.7%-41.9% [14]. Moreover, the prevalence of HTN is disproportionately more prevalent and it increases alarmingly in poor resource countries, like Ethiopia [11]. But it might be helpful to mitigate and manage/control the risk of HTN if identification of HTN patients with interpretable risk factors at an early stage. Thus, early detection of HTN patients with identification of interpretable risk factors plays a key role, which could help to get the patients timely prevention and intervention. It is therefore highly essential to detect/diagnosis and identify the interpretable risk factors of HTN at an early stage.

Many convincing research and empirical studies determined several risk factors associated with HTN in LMICs countries, including Ethiopia [15–21]. Nevertheless, existing association studies had several limitations. Most importantly, previous existing studies considered traditional linear models, such as logistic regression (LR), Cox proportional hazard model, for identifying the significantly associated risk factors of HTN [22–24]. Moreover, a real data with high-dimensional non-linear pattern presents a challenge to traditional linear models, and low precision of linear models impedes patients-level use. To overcome those limitations with complex real data, machine learning (ML) might be a right choice, which is being widely used in current public health research fields. ML is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), in which the algorithms that execute the prediction process collect the necessary information from previous experiences and/or detect patterns in data to accomplish a task, typically a classification or identification [25–28]. It can provide several advantages, including automatic specific process, reliable probabilistic estimation for uncovering hidden patterns or relationships with high accuracy while lowering labor costs and time for large amounts of data that aid in decision-making or inference, and model interpretability [29–31]. There are different types of learning algorithm in ML, among them supervised learning is the most popular and widely applicable. The supervised learning algorithm’s goal is to use the dataset to build a model that can predict the system’s output given new inputs. The major two types of supervised learning algorithm are regression and classification. Example of regression include linear regression and logistic regression [32]. Examples of classification include ensemble methods, decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), artificial neural network (ANN), so on [32, 33]. The ensemble method is a machine learning technique that combine multiple models with the same learning algorithm to achieve better predictive performance [34]. Ensemble methods include eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB), adaBoost, histogram-based gradient boosting classification Tree, and random forest (RF) [25]. However, previously, some researcher’s conducted their study to develop multivariable prediction models using several ML and explainable artificial intelligence methods [35–37]. Most of the existing risk prediction models were developed with limited number of risk factors that provided less accuracy for predicting HTN patient [35, 38]. However, DT and ensemble approaches have attracted a great attention in recent years for identifying individuals at risk of HTN, there is no evidence that these algorithms are successfully applied in Ethiopian clinical settings.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that applied and builds a predictive model using ML algorithms for predicting the individual risk of HTN in Ethiopia. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop an efficient ensemble based explainable ML framework for predicting patients with the risk of HTN in Ethiopia.

Furthermore, we employed under-sampling and adaptive syntactic (ADASYN) class balancing strategy to enhance the confidence score of the developed prediction models. For model interpretation, we identified the key risk factors of HTN and direction of the relationship between the risk factors and HTN using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which is a post hoc model interpretation technique viz. theoretically based on the Shapley value. The overall pipeline of the explainable machine learning based framework is displayed in Fig 1.","In this study, we investigate several ML-based algorithms to propose an explainable framework for predicting the risk of HTN in Ethiopia. We trained up four ML algorithms (ANN, SVM, RF, and XGB) to predict HTN, using 16 risk factors obtained from Boruta feature selection method. The performance of the developed models compared by accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve with AUC value on testing set. Based on performance measurements, we proposed XGB model as the most appropriate candidate classifier for predicting HTN.

Several studies were conducted using ML framework to predict the risk of HTN. A comparison of the present study with the existing studies is presented in Table 7. Chowdhury et al. [54] proposed a system on 18,322 respondents with 24 candidate risk factors in Canada. Before constructing the models, they applied five top FSM for selecting the significant risk factors and adopted five ML algorithms LASSO, Elastic Net, random survival forest (RSF), and gradient boosting, with the conventional Cox proportional hazard model for predicting HTN. They measure the performance of the models by C-index for each model. Pratiwi OA [35] applied four ML algorithms such as DT, RF, GB, and LR for predicting individual risk of HTN in Indonesia. He developed the model by K10 protocol based on training set and prediction performance of these models was measure on testing set in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. He indicated LR is the best performer marginally compared to others with AUC (0.829). Oanh and Tung [55] suggested a ML based model to predict patient with the risk of HTN in Vietnam. The model was developed by Naïve Bayes (NB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), SVM, and ensemble algorithms: bagging (RF), boosting and voting based on training set. The performance of the models was assessed by testing set in terms of F1-score, precision, and recall. Islam et al. [38] conducted a study on three countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and India. They included 818603 respondents with seven risk factors and performed GT, RF, GBM, XGB, LR, LDA algorithms for predicting HTN patients. They focused that XGB achieved the best performance score than others. Chai et al. [56] used Malaysian data with 2461 respondents and 11 covariates to develop a system for diagnosing HTN patients by 3 different types of algorithms, including neural network (MLP), classical model (LR, DT, NB, k-NN), and ensemble model (RF, SVM, GB, XGB, LightGBM, CatBoost, AdaBoost, and LogitBoost). Before building the model, they adopted correlation-based FSM to select a set of leading features and utilized SMOTE technique to balance membership class label of the data. They evaluate the predictive ability of the models by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1-score, misclassification rate, and AUC on testing set and found that LightGBM based model acquired the best accuracy with 74.39%. Islam et al. [57] used nationally representative HTN data in Bangladesh. The data consisted of 6965 subjects with 13 risk factors. They determine the prominent risk factors of HTN by two popular FSM such as LASSO and SVMRFE in Bangladesh. They utilized then K10 protocol to construct model using four ML algorithms on training set and measured the performance of the models on testing set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1- score and AUC. Overall experimental sittings demonstrated that gradient boosting model attained the best score of AUC (0.669). Zheng et al. [58] explored a system for predicting HTN patients using several ML techniques in USA. No feature selection method had used to select the prominent features of HTN before constructing ML-based system. They found that ANN model reached the maximum performance score. Alkaabi et al. [59] utilized HTN data in Qatar. The dataset comprised of 987 respondents with 12 risk factors. They adopted 3 ML-based algorithms including DT, RF, and LR. Overall experimental results anticipated that RF model provided better generalization predictive ability than others.
Thus, the comparative results suggested that our proposed XGB framework can predict HTN with higher AUC (Table 7). Moreover, SHAP analysis with the proposed method revealed that age, weight, fat, income, diabetes, BMI, height, salt, smoking, and HHTN were the associated risk factors for developing HTN. Local explanation summary plot showed that age is the 1st leading risk factor of HTN in Ethiopia. A study conducted by Belay et al., [2022] in Ethiopia found that a patient with age>60 years was two times more likely to have HTN than those with age 18–40 years [11]. This result also supported by several systematic review and meta-analysis studies [60, 61]. The vascular system of our body changes in arteries, particularly with large artery stiffness caused by older age. Weight and fat are the 2nd and 3rd leading drivers of HTN. This finding supports the conclusions of earlier investigations [62]. Excess body weight increases visceral and retroperitoneal fat, which can contribute to the development of HTN. Household income is linked to the risk of HTN, which was in line with the prior investigations [63]. Due to a number of reasons, including the ongoing nutritional transition, rising trends in sedentary lifestyle, and other modifiable risk factors, people from low-income families may have a greater burden from the disease [64]. BMI is another gradient of HTN which is corroborated with the earlier studies [65]. BMI might be a cause of HTN and other cardiovascular disease by stimulating the renin-aldosterone system and endothelial dysfunction [66]. Diabetes is another important marker of HTN. The two medical conditions diabetes and HTN may cause each other and share common risk factors. HHTN is another important covariate of HTN. This result is also coincided with the previous studies conducted in Ethiopia and other countries [67]. This might be as family member share same genetic factors, behaviors, mostly similar lifestyle, and environments related factor that could influence the risk of HTN disease. Additionally, other risk factors such as salt, drinking alcohol, and smoking were found to be an important contributing risk factors of HTN, which is similar with other studies in literature [68, 69]. Although this work has many strengths, it also has some limitations, such as the sample only included permanent the residents of the city administration who had lived in the area for more than six months and were older than 30. Additionally, it did not measure the amount of alcohol, cigarettes, fruits, vegetables, fats, and salts that were consumed in measurable units."
10.1155/2020/9108216,cai,2020,"Background: Hypertension is now common in China. Patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes are prone to severe cardiovascular complications and poor prognosis. Therefore, this study is aimed at establishing an effective risk prediction model to provide early prediction of the risk of new-onset diabetes for patients with a history of hypertension.

Methods: A LASSO regression model was used to select potentially relevant features. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine independent predictors. Based on the results of multivariate analysis, a nomogram of the 5-year incidence of T2D in patients with hypertension in mainland China was established. The discriminative capacity was assessed by Harrell's C-index, AUC value, calibration plot, and clinical utility.

Results: After random sampling, 1273 and 415 patients with hypertension were included in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The prediction model included age, body mass index, FPG, and TC as predictors. In the derivation cohort, the AUC value and C-index of the prediction model are 0.878 (95% CI, 0.861-0.895) and 0.862 (95% CI, 0.830-0.894), respectively. In the validation cohort, the AUC value and C-index of the prediction model were 0.855 (95% CI, 0.836-0.874) and 0.841 (95% CI, 0.817-0.865), respectively. The calibration plots demonstrated good agreement between the estimated probability and the actual observation. Decision curve analysis shows that nomograms are clinically useful.

Conclusion: Our nomogram can be used as a simple, affordable, reasonable, and widely implemented tool to predict the 5-year T2D risk of hypertension patients in mainland China. This application helps timely intervention to reduce the incidence of T2D in patients with hypertension in mainland China.","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a form of hyperglycemia caused by insulin resistance and related insulin deficiency, accounting for 90%-95% of all diabetes [1]. The growing burden of T2D has become the focus of global public health attention in the 21st century [2]. Previously, T2D was the most common in the rich “western” developed countries [3]. But at present, T2D has become an epidemic in developing countries [4]. China is among the most populous countries in the world, and the country with the most diabetes cases in the world, with an estimated 120.9 million adults suffering from diabetes [5]. T2D patients have to bear high medical expenses every year. It is estimated that the global medical expenditure for T2D in 2017 was approximately $850 billion [6]. In addition, T2D can cause a variety of complications, such as diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetic retinopathy [3]. There are numerous causes of T2D. Although the specific reasons are not clear, a large number of studies have pointed out that T2D may be related to lifestyle, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors [4].

High blood pressure is the single only risk factor responsible for the global burden of disease, and 9.4 million people worldwide die of hypertension every year [7]. It is pointed out that hypertension and T2D often coexist, and about 70% of T2D patients also have hypertension [8]. Patients with a history of hypertension are nearly 2.5 times more likely to develop T2D than normal people [9]. Compared with patients with hypertension or T2D alone, patients with hypertension and T2D have an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death [10]. Analysis of the Framingham cohort showed that patients with elevated blood pressure at the time of T2D diagnosis had higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality than patients without T2D [11].

Due to the greatly increased prevalence of diabetes in patients with a history of hypertension, it has caused huge economic costs and serious complications. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish an effective risk prediction model, which can provide an early prediction for the risk of new-onset diabetes in patients with a history of hypertension, provide timely intervention measures to prevent or delay the occurrence of T2D, and ultimately reduce the adverse cardiovascular prognosis of such patients.","With the development of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards, T2D is on the rise worldwide, which is thought to be the third largest disease that threatens human health, next to cancer and cardiovascular disease [21]. T2D and its complications are one of the major economic burdens in the present era [22]. China has the largest number of patients with diabetes in the world. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the annual cost of diabetes in China is $ 25 billion [23]. It is estimated that these costs will continue to increase and will exceed $ 47 billion by 2030 [24]. A large number of studies have shown that hypertension is closely related to impaired glucose tolerance [25]. T2D is more common in patients with hypertension than in patients without a history of hypertension. The coexistence of DM and hypertension significantly increase the risk for coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and stroke compared to either condition alone [10]. In addition, both hypertension and DM are present in all prediction models for the occurrence of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation [26]. Microvascular complications are also more common in patients with coexistent hypertension and DM, and both retinopathy and nephropathy are more prevalent in patients with DM and hypertension [10]. Therefore, primary prevention and timely intervention are the keys to prevent or delay the onset of T2D in patients with hypertension [11]. Early detection of people at high risk for diabetes is critical to reducing morbidity, which led us to this study.

In this community-based cohort study, we developed a quantifiable and simple nomogram to predict the 5-year T2D risk of hypertension patients in mainland China. In the derivation and validation cohorts, our model shows higher prediction accuracy, relatively high C-index, and excellent calibration curve consistency. As far as we know, this study is the first nomogram to estimate the risk of type 2 diabetes in Chinese mainland hypertension patients using continuous values rather than segmented values. In addition, the nomogram will be of great practical value because of their easily obtained parameters. In this study, we developed a nomogram based on a large-scale multicenter population of China. Although it has been reported that more than 40 T2D risk prediction models have been established among different populations, there are few risk prediction models based on the East Asian race, especially the Chinese population [27–30]. Taking into account the genetic and environmental differences (i.e., economic level, diet, climate, and lifestyle), the intensity or distribution of T2D risk factors varies among different populations, complex mathematical formulas, and the lack of simple and intuitive tools to facilitate the use of these predictive risk models [14]. Therefore, few models are currently used clinical practice. Our study is the first nomogram to predict the 5-year incidence of T2D in hypertensive patients in mainland China. Nomogram is a graphical representation of a complex mathematical formula, which is widely used in the study of tumor prognosis [31, 32]. However, a few types of research have focused on developing this easy-to-use T2D risk prediction tool. The nomogram can generate individual T2D probability by integrating various risk prediction factors, which can meet our needs for visualization tools and meet our progress towards personalized prevention [33]. Compared with traditional mathematical formulas, through the user-friendly digital interface, higher accuracy, and easier to understand risk prediction, rapid calculation of the nomogram can seamlessly integrate risk assessment into clinical decision-making [34]. Using these simple, fast, cheap, noninvasive tools, we hope to be able to effectively identify individuals with a high risk of 5-year T2D in patients with hypertension. Medical interventions, lifestyle changes, diagnostic management, and treatment then can be initiated, and ultimately the patient's prognosis can be improved.

Our prediction models include age, BMI, FBG, and TC. These variables identified as risk factors for T2D were consistent with previous studies. Multiple studies have found that dyslipidemia, obesity, and T2D usually coexist in individuals and share common pathological mechanisms (metabolic disorders, insulin resistance, inflammation, and changes in the intestinal flora) [35–37]. Therefore, the application of these parameters in the model is well founded. T2D usually occurs in adults and is more common in the elderly. Numerous studies have proven that advanced age is an unchangeable risk factor for the manifestation of diabetes [3, 38]. Aging β-cells may exhibit lower glucose responsiveness and glucose sensitivity, leading to hyperglycemia and T2D [39]. The epigenetic changes caused by aging may affect islet gene expression and insulin secretion [40]. Davegårdh et al. [41] found that age-related changes in pancreatic islet DNA methylation can increase insulin resistance, cause impaired β-cell function, and induce T2D. Impaired FBG is one of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes. Studies have shown that hemoglobin A1c, FBG, and 2hPG can predict diabetes, but the detection reliability of hemoglobin A1c and FBG is better than 2hPG [42]. In addition, compared with A1c hemoglobin, the feasibility and applicability of FBG detection in low-resource settings are more prominent [43]. In our predictive model, BMI was one of the main aspects of all diabetic risk factor scores. It is well known that T2D is usually associated with overweight and obese individuals [44, 45]. Obesity, especially long-lasting and visceral obesity, is the cornerstone of T2D pathogenesis [46]. According to gender and ethnicity, the incidence rate of BMI in patients with T2D ranges from 50% to 90% was 25 kg/m2, and the incidence of T2D in elderly obese patients was higher [47]. It is worth noting that even if BMI is less than 25 kg/m2, the relative risk of diabetes in adults seems to increase, and it increases exponentially with BMI [47]. The pathophysiological pathways behind this association are complex and progressive, leading to the development of insulin resistance and secondary impairment of β-cell function [44, 46, 47]. Obesity-induced metabolic disorders, adipose organ dysfunction, and changes in fat metabolic processes play a fundamental role in insulin resistance [44]. Excess energy induces insulin resistance by inhibiting adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in obese patients [44, 48]. According to previous studies, dyslipidemia is a well-known risk factor for T2D [49]. Similar to those reports, patients with TC abnormalities had higher T2D risk scores on the nomogram. The underlying pathophysiology of dyslipidemia leading to insulin resistance is complex and has not been well understood [36]. At present, some studies have pointed out that TC itself may directly lead to disorders of glucose metabolism [37, 50]. TC can also increase insulin secretion by protecting β-cells from cholesterol-induced β-cell dysfunction, stress-induced apoptosis, and islet inflammation [46, 47]. The higher level of TC may exacerbate abnormal glucose homeostasis. In contrast, oxidized low-density lipoprotein can inhibit molecular insulin secretion and even cause β-cell apoptosis [39, 40].

In this study, we established a nomogram model of 5-year T2D incidence of hypertension patients in mainland China by using parameters that can be collected in the general health care settings. This will have a major impact on the clinic and society, especially for residents in mainland China, where OGTT is not easily accessible. Our nomogram provides a quantitative way to distinguish the high-risk group of T2D in patients with hypertension who must focus on their own physical condition and follow advanced intervention strategies (e.g., appropriate drug intervention, lifestyle intervention, and/or surgical operation) to prevent or at least delay the development of T2D in patients with hypertension. At the same time, for low-risk T2D populations, no further screening of T2D is needed, which can increase the cost-effectiveness of T2D screening. This simple risk assessment tool can be accepted by the medical staff and nonprofessionals.

Although our nomograms performed well in both the derivation and validation cohorts, there are still some limitations in this study. First, all participants are from China. Therefore, the result may not apply to other countries. Second, although our analysis includes a wide range of potential predictors, there are other factors that cannot be measured, such as insulin secretion, which leads to the limited predictive power of the model. Third, the nomogram is based on a retrospective cohort study in which individuals with incomplete data are excluded, which may lead to selection bias. Therefore, prospective studies are needed to further validate our results. Fourth, although the genomic classifier is considered a promising predictive tool, this study did not consider genomic characteristics. Fifth, the lack of treatment data for participants in the study may interfere with the development of diabetes. Sixth, failure to perform HbA1c and oral glucose tolerance tests may mask diabetes events at baseline or during follow-up. Despite these limitations, the study was the first large cohort study in mainland China to predict 5-year T2D incidence in patients with hypertension."
10.1111/eci.13633,abellana,2021,"Background: Several scores to identify patients at high risk of suffering atrial fibrillation have been developed. Their applicability in hypertensive diabetic patients, however, remains uncertain. Our aim is to develop and validate a diagnostic predictive model to calculate the risk of developing atrial fibrillation at five years in a hypertensive diabetic population.

Methods: The derivation cohort consisted of patients with both hypertension and diabetes attended in any of the 52 primary healthcare centres of Barcelona; the validation cohort came from the 11 primary healthcare centres of Terres de l'Ebre (Catalonia South) from January 2013 to December 2017. Multivariable Cox regression identified clinical risk factors associated with the development of atrial fibrillation. The overall performance, discrimination and calibration of the model were carried out.

Results: The derivation data set comprised 54 575 patients. The atrial fibrillation rate incidence was 15.3 per 1000 person/year. A 5-year predictive model included age, male gender, overweight, heart failure, valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, number of antihypertensive drugs, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, thromboembolism, stroke and previous history of myocardial infarction. The discrimination of the model was good (c-index = 0.692; 95% confidence interval, 0.684-0.700), and calibration was adequate. In the validation cohort, the discrimination was lower (c-index = 0.670).

Conclusions: The model accurately predicts future atrial fibrillation in a population with both diabetes and hypertension. Early detection allows the prevention of possible complications arising from this disease.","Worldwide, atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in adults with a current prevalence of 2%–4%.1 It has been estimated that one in three European citizens aged over 55 years will develop this condition.2 Patients with AF have a fivefold greater risk of stroke, a higher incidence of heart failure and increased mortality.3 AF is commonly observed in diabetic patients, and prevalence rates are estimated to be at least double that of nondiabetic subjects.4 Moreover, in diabetic patients with hypertension, a frequent coexisting condition, AF prevalence is up to three times higher than in AF patients with only hypertension or diabetes.5

Hypertension is the most common risk factor associated with AF.3 Indeed, it has been reported that the risk for new-onset AF almost doubles, and progression to permanent AF multiplies by 1.5, when this condition is present.6 The pathophysiological mechanisms by which hypertension leads to AF are multiple: persistently high pressures can produce ventricular hypertrophy, insufficient muscle relaxation and consequently left atrial overload, fibrosis and structural remodelling at this level. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may also be one of the inducers of AF in certain hypertensive patients. Both angiotensin and aldosterone are pro-inflammatory molecules that cause fibrosis in the atrium, which is closely related to AF.7 Individuals with hypertension and AF have a high prevalence of comorbidities, which raises the risk of all-cause mortality and thromboembolic events.8

With respect to diabetes mellitus, a higher risk of suffering a cardiovascular disease, and at least twice the risk of a fatal event when it is present, has been reported.9 Diabetes is related to an increase in the size of the left atrium, regardless of hypertension or diastolic function; it also causes sympathetic and parasympathetic denervation at the same level.10

A reliable, easy-to-apply tool that allows early detection of AF is crucial in clinical practice, particularly in hypertensive and diabetic patients. AF may remain undiscovered for months or years and is often undiagnosed or untreated until stroke occurs. Due to the lack of AF detection in the early stages, stroke constitutes the first manifestation of unknown AF in 25% of cases.11

Several scores predicting the risk of developing AF have already been created, such as the CHARGE-AF Consortium,12 the Framingham Heart Study,13 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC),14 Women's Health Study,15 LADS16 and HATCH score.17 Nevertheless, none of them is specific for predicting AF in hypertensive diabetic patients who are at greater risk. Moreover, the prognostic variables necessary to predict AF, and the individual weights of these variables in the construction of the risk function, may vary slightly compared to those of the general population.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a diagnostic predictive model to calculate the risk of developing AF in a hypertensive diabetic population.","In hypertensive diabetic patients, the identified predictive variables of AF risk were age, male gender, overweight, heart failure, valvular heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, number of antihypertensive drugs, SBP, DBP, heart rate and thromboembolism. From a clinical perspective, our risk model will help clinicians to evaluate the risk of AF developing in a high-risk population.

Predictive models for AF carried out in a general population, such as CHARGE-AF Consortium12 and Mayo Clinic,24 include several prognostic variables. Nevertheless, only a few of them are common in both scores, for instance heart failure, age, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, demonstrating the consistency and importance of these conditions with respect to AF. When we tested the CHARGE predictive model in our population, we found a reduction in its predictive capacity, the c-index decreasing from 0.76 to 0.66, whilst the Mayo Clinic model showed a c-index of 0.66.

To the best of our knowledge, no models specifically predicting the risk of AF in patients simultaneously presenting hypertension and diabetes have been reported. Yang et al developed a predictive model for diabetic patients25 and found that age, gender, race, history of heart failure, DBP, BMI, triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), diabetes duration, hypertensive medication and creatinine presented a concordance similar to our model. Regarding hypertension, Orozco-Beltran et al worked on a model to predict AF risk in a population with this condition. They included age, male gender, obesity and heart failure as independent predictors and reported a slightly lower concordance.26

In our cohort, the number of antihypertensive drugs needed to control blood pressure was related to a higher AF risk. It has been reported that adequate management of hypertension may prevent AF by reducing atrial stretch and suppressing electrical and structural cardiac remodelling.27, 28

In line with our findings, an increased risk of AF related to obesity, due to its deleterious effect on hypertension and diabetes, has been published.29, 30

Cardiovascular diseases and risk factors (heart failure, valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and chronic kidney disease) presented an association with AF in our study, as expected according to published evidence.31 In addition, higher mortality rates have been found in patients with heart failure.32

Higher SBP was related to greater AF incidence which also concurs with other studies.12, 14 Tremblay et al observed that SBP >140 mmHg was associated with an increased risk of recurrent AF in subjects who have left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF <40%). We have no available data concerning ejection fraction in our cohort to precisely classify such results.7 Muria-Subirats et al also reported an inverse relationship between heart rate and DBP with AF in diabetic and hypertensive patients, that is to say, patients with a lower heart rate and DBP were more likely to develop AF.33

Several scores had been created for measuring AF risk across a broad spectrum of the general population. Nevertheless, our model specifically provides an accurate classification for hypertensive diabetic patients, a group at an elevated risk, by facilitating on-time diagnosis. Among the predictive variables, only blood pressure and body weight could be prevented. However, the early detection of high AF risk permits a close follow-up and better management to prevent the occurrence of this disease, and eventually serves to prevent the terrible consequences of arrhythmia, mainly stroke."
10.1038/s41598-023-28059-4,yang,2023,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with hypertension (DH) is the most common diabetic comorbidity. Patients with DH have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram model for the prediction of an individual's risk of developing DH. A total of 706 T2DM patients who met the criteria were selected and divided into a training set (n = 521) and a validation set (n = 185) according to the discharge time of patients. By using multivariate logistic regression analysis and stepwise regression, the DH nomogram prediction model was created. Calibration curves were used to evaluate the model's accuracy, while decision curve analysis (DCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the model's clinical applicability and discriminatory power. Age, body mass index (BMI), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic retinopathy (DR) were all independent risk factors for DH (P < 0.05). Based on independent risk factors identified by multivariate logistic regression, the nomogram model was created. The model produces accurate predictions. If the total nomogram score is greater than 120, there is a 90% or higher chance of developing DH. In the training and validation sets, the model's ROC curves are 0.762 (95% CI 0.720-0.803) and 0.700 (95% CI 0.623-0.777), respectively. The calibration curve demonstrates that there is good agreement between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes. The decision curve analysis findings demonstrated that the nomogram model was clinically helpful throughout a broad threshold probability range. The DH risk prediction nomogram model constructed in this study can help clinicians identify individuals at high risk for DH at an early stage, which is a guideline for personalized prevention and treatments.","Diabetes is a metabolic disease with a high global prevalence. About 42.2 million adults worldwide have diabetes, which is projected to reach 642 million by 2045, according to the World Health Organization1. Data from the Chinese National Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders Study2, the Chinese Chronic Non-Communicable Disease Surveillance System3, and the Chinese Survey of Chronic Diseases and Their Risk Factors4with large population samples showed that the prevalence of diabetes in China was 9.7%, 11.6%, and 10.9%, respectively. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often coexists with hypertension (DH). In a cross-sectional study conducted in China from 2010 to 2012, 25,817 type 2 diabetic patients were included. The results showed that 59.8% of diabetic patients combined with hypertension5. A retrospective study based on the Chinese population in Taiwan found that the proportion of hypertension in T2DM patients was also very high (53.9% of insulin users, and 61.3% of non-insulin users)6.

Diabetes combined with hypertension is associated with a higher risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease. A 10.9-year follow-up study in Shanghai found that the coexistence of diabetes and hypertension increased cardiovascular disease risk up to 3.34 times7. Furthermore, T2DM patients with hypertension are at higher risk of developing diabetic complications such as retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy, which increases the burden on families and society8,9. T2DM combined with hypertension has a much higher mortality rate than T2DM patients without hypertension so early treatment and active prevention of cardiovascular diseases have become a hot research topic in recent years10.

The exploration of independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by hypertension and the taking of effective preventive measures could effectively reduce the risk of diabetes11. As far as I know, few studies have been done on predictive models and risk factor analyses of hypertension in type 2 diabetes. Xue et al. found age and obesity to be determinants in a study of risk factors for hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes in a Chinese community, which is similar to our findings, but unfortunately, they did not include diabetes-related complications in the model, which is formally an innovation of our model12.

The purpose of this study was to analyze risk factors for type 2 diabetes associated with hypertension using available clinical data. In order to identify T2DM patients with the possibility of hypertension, a nomogram model was constructed based on independent risk factors. Thus, it can effectively prevent hypertension; reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients, and improve the quality of life of patients","The prevalence of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes was 56.9% which was 1.32 times higher than that in patients without hypertension in this study. This finding is similar to the findings of hypertension prevalence in type 2 diabetic patients from a universal health checkup conducted in Urumqi, Xinjiang, China in 201812. Therefore, to better predict the risk of combined hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes, we constructed a hypertension risk nomogram prediction modeAThe nomogram is a visual tool for predicting the probability of occurrence of events based on statistical models with multiple factors28. Over the past few years, the use of nomograms to construct predictive models has become widely adopted29. The ability of clinical nomogram prediction models to more accurately predict individual disease risk based on different patient conditions may aid clinical decision-making. Stepwise regression results combined with multifactorial logistic regression model analysis in this study showed that age, BMI, DN, and RD were independent risk factors for DH.

The results of this study showed that age was a risk factor for hypertension. Hypertension prevalence increased with age30,31. This can be mainly due to the gradual hardening of the large arteries as we age and the gradual loss of vascular elasticity, leading to increased blood pressure32. Variability in blood pressure also increases with age, and in addition to these age-related factors, comorbidities such as dyslipidemia and elevated blood glucose increase with aging. Over time, vascular endothelial cell dysfunction occurs, with a decline in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and aging of the kidney, which leads to restricted arterial dilation33. Therefore, patients with type 2 diabetes need to have their blood pressure monitored more closely as they age, and if hypertension is detected, it needs to be controlled with appropriate medications based on lifestyle interventions to reduce the risk of heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.

In the prediction model, BMI was an influential factor in the development of hypertension, which is consistent with previous studies34. In addition, Huang et al. also found that BMI was an independent risk factor for hypertension risk35. Similarly, a study conducted in Taiwan found that BMI is the main and independent determinant of blood pressure and hypertension in adult type 2 diabetes patients in Taiwan36. BMI is currently used clinically as an indicator of overweight or obesity. Compared to other commonly used measures of obesity, BMI is the most sensitive body indicator to predict high blood pressure in adults37. At the pathophysiological level, the core mechanism of obesity associated with T2DM is insulin resistance. Similarly, the mechanisms associated with the development of obesity and hypertension include insulin resistance, and the remaining mechanisms include inflammation, oxidation, active stress, and excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system38–40. These factors interact to cause systemic hemodynamic alterations. The obese population is at high risk for hypertension and obesity promotes atherosclerosis41. Pathophysiological changes associated with obesity include increased arterial stiffness42, as well as altered reflex sensitivity to pressure receptors, which is also responsible for increased variability in blood pressure. Therefore, patients with type 2 diabetes need good lifestyle interventions43, such as smoking cessation and alcohol restriction, moderate exercise, low-salt and low-fat and multi-vitamin diets, which can effectively maintain a healthy body state and reduce weight. These measures can effectively improve insulin resistance, which not only facilitates blood glucose control but also has beneficial effects on blood pressure and blood lipids44.

Microvascular complications are the leading cause of mortality in diabetic patients, and DN and DR are the most severe microvascular complications. Common pathogenesis shared by DR and isare high glucose toxicity, free radicals, oxidative stress of inflammatory mediators, and abnormal polyols metabolism, all of which play very important roles45. Most people with type 2 diabetes will develop DN and DR if they have had diabetes for more than 20 years. As chronic hyperglycemia impairs vascular endothelial cell function, vascular inflammation occurs, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular elasticity46 and increased peripheral resistance. The kidney is both an important organ for blood pressure regulation and a major target organ for hypertension damage. DN causes disorders in salt and water regulation in the kidney, especially abnormalities in the renin-angiotensin system47 and abnormalities in the sympathetic nervous system48. All of the above factors interact with each other, resulting in the development and progression of hypertension49, whereas the presence of hypertension may further worsen DR and DN50.

There are some limitations in this study: firstly, the data in this study were obtained from a single center and were retrospective, which may have some information bias and patient selection bias; a prospective study design is necessary for the future. Secondly, in terms of model validation, only internal validation was performed, and further validation of the model with a large multicenter sample is needed to assess the applicability of the model in the future. Finally, we did not collect information about coronary heart disease, stroke, lower limb amputation, heart failure, and other diseases highly related to hypertension, which may affect the prediction ability of our model."
10.1155/2023/8898958,zaizar,2023,"Diabetes mellitus is a disease with no cure that can cause complications and even death. Moreover, over time, it will lead to chronic complications. Predictive models have been used to identify people with a tendency to develop diabetes mellitus. At the same time, there is limited information regarding the chronic complications of patients with diabetes. Our study is aimed at creating a machine-learning model that will be able to identify the risk factors of a diabetic patient developing chronic complications such as amputations, myocardial infarction, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The design is a national nested case-control study with 63,776 patients and 215 predictors with four years of data. Using an XGBoost model, the prediction of chronic complications has an AUC of 84%, and the model has identified the risk factors for chronic complications in patients with diabetes. According to the analysis, the most crucial risk factors based on SHAP values (Shapley additive explanations) are continued management, metformin treatment, age between 68 and 104 years, nutrition consultation, and treatment adherence. But we highlight two exciting findings. The first is a reaffirmation that high blood pressure figures across patients with diabetes without hypertension become a significant risk factor at diastolic > 70 mmHg (OR: 1.095, 95% CI: 1.078-1.113) or systolic > 120 mmHg (OR: 1.147, 95% CI: 1.124-1.171). Furthermore, people with diabetes with a BMI > 32 (overall obesity) (OR: 0.816, 95% CI: 0.8-0.833) have a statistically significant protective factor, which the paradox of obesity may explain. In conclusion, the results we have obtained show that artificial intelligence is a powerful and feasible tool to use for this type of study. However, we suggest that more studies be conducted to verify and elaborate upon our findings.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder that causes abnormal blood glucose (BG) regulation, resulting in short and long-term health complications and even death if not properly managed. Unfortunately, there is no cure for DM [1, 2]. Hence, it is an increasingly prevalent chronic disease with patients prone to an increased morbidity and mortality rate [3, 4]. Mexico has a substantially high prevalence of metabolic disorders; 75.2% of the Mexican population is obese or overweight, 10.3% have DM, and 19.5% have dyslipidemia [5]. In addition, DM has been related to long-term neurological, microvascular, and macrovascular complications. Over time, it leads to neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease [6].

Complications from DM represent the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the population with diabetes [7]. Therefore, generating information on risk factors for complications is highly relevant for developing tools that patients or physicians can use to anticipate the disease or its complications and take appropriate measures [8]. For example, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diabetes risk test identifies the risk of developing DM2 [9], and the diabetic foot self-care questionnaire (DFSQ) helps to identify risks and prevent injuries or amputations of the feet [8].

Additionally, the use of prediction models to identify people at high risk of DM has been recommended by NICE [10], European guidelines for the prevention of type 2 DM [11], and the International Diabetes Federation [12]. Nevertheless, studies have yet to be conducted about DM, its complications, and risk factors [13].

Scientists can tailor learning models to find complex patterns within big data [14] using machine learning methods to effectively deliver integrative solutions for multiview data to explain an event or predict an outcome [15]. Furthermore, the ability of a model to find statistical patterns across millions of features and examples enables superhuman performance [16].

Due to the high prevalence of DM in the Mexican population and the lack of a model trained within such a population, we decided to develop a machine learning model on a national program’s electronic medical records for patients with diabetes. Our goal is to identify risk factors for patients with diabetes complications through artificial intelligence.","Despite current scientific advances, the vast amount of data prevents humans from extracting the maximum benefit. This has become the main limitation for scientific research since as researchers, we cannot operate at the scope, scale, and speed necessary for the amount and complexity of the collected data. For this reason, artificial intelligence is the most appropriate tool to make the most of all this data and transform it into helpful information for doctors and patients [17].

For example, it was previously mentioned that the first studies consulted had preselected the predictive variables through a literature review and not a statistical method [36–39]. However, this study has allowed the exclusion and inclusion of variables to be performed through statistical discrimination that analyzes the machine learning model through the value of SHAP [30–33].

Despite this, there are authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that issue publications with reported risk factors for patients with diabetes: smoking, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, systemic arterial hypertension, and hyperglycemia [40, 41].

Starting with smoking, we agree that this risk factor increases the risk of suffering any of the five events studied by 2.045 times. However, our study dove deeper into smoking as a risk factor. Stratifying the patient’s years of smoking, we find an almost constant risk ratio, where smoking from 1 to 56 years increases the risk 1.22-1.33 times.

Obesity has been recognized as a health risk factor for many years. The risk of morbidity and mortality associated with it is high, as is insulin resistance, which frequently causes diabetes. But a growing body of research indicates that patients with obesity have a higher chance of surviving [42–44]. According to the so-called “obesity paradox,” persons who are obese survive health issues more often than people who are average weight. People with obesity may have the metabolic reserves required to balance the increased catabolic load during a health issue. In our analysis (see Table 3), we have found that a BMI greater than 32 (obesity) is a protective factor, which aligns with the obesity paradox theory. A BMI of less than 30 is presented as a risk factor.

Turning to physical activity, we found that this variable acts as a risk factor with an increase of 1.33 times the probability of suffering from a chronic complication as a person with diabetes. We understand that these results are controversial. However, we remind readers that this study is based on what was recorded in the patient files. Therefore, there was no way physicians ensured that the patients that carried out the said activity knew the type of activity, its duration, or its intensity. Furthermore, given the study’s observational nature, we limit ourselves only to reporting what was found, recognizing its limitations.

This study used arterial hypertension as an exclusion criterion for patients, so the hypertension effect cannot be reflected on the variables. However, we have the blood pressure data of the patients involved in this study. We found that diastolic pressure becomes a risk factor from 70 mmHg with an increase of 1.09-1.20 times the risk. On the other hand, systolic pressure is presented as a risk factor from 120 mmHg, increasing the risk 1.14-1.23 times. In addition, we calculated the pulse pressure, which was a risk factor from 40 mmHg with an increase of 1.04-1.20 times the risk. These results conclude that in patients with diabetes but without hypertension, high blood pressure does act as a risk factor even when there is no official diagnosis.

The JNC 8 recommends a therapeutic control goal in patients with diabetes and hypertension less than 140/90 mmHg without a clinical trial as evidence. Based on a national analysis of patients with nonhypertensive diabetics, we add evidence to this recommendation. Despite being a more stringent goal (120/70 mmHg), it seeks to prevent the same complications exposed by JNC 8 (mortality, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events). We base this goal on the data presented in Table 3, which indicates that blood pressure in people with diabetes without hypertension is a significant protective factor at diastolic < 70 mmHg (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.826, 0.853) or systolic < 120 mmHg (OR: 0.974, 95% CI: 0.957, 0.991).

After obesity, arterial hypertension is the second most common cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preventing, diagnosing, and controlling high blood pressure are a global health priority only achieved by measuring blood pressure. In today’s modern world, self-measurement with validated devices would be beneficial to involve the patient in treatment and follow-up [45].

Thus, the CDC’s last variable is the risk factor hyperglycemia. In this case, we find that hyperglycemia recorded as an acute complication is a risk factor that increases the probability of a chronic complication by 4.5 times. However, we can again use the stratification of the numerical variables to provide specificity to these variables. Thus, fasting blood glucose is presented as a risk factor from 185 mg/dL, increasing 1.16-1.7 times the probability of suffering from a chronic complication. In addition, the fasting glucose gives us a view of these patients’ adaptation to the variation in their blood glucose. Studying it through HbA1c, it appears to be a risk factor from 6%, increasing 1.07-1.18 times the probability of a chronic complication.

In addition to the variables considered by the CDC, there are publications, such as Abhari et al. and James et al., mentioning that blood pressure variables should be studied independently with machine learning techniques [46, 47]. This was a reason we included the stratification of blood pressure and added pulse pressure.

Knuiman et al. reported that age is the primary variable related to complications of diabetes mellitus [38]. However, we believe that, in this case, we can provide specificity. Although the variable may be a risk factor, we found that age becomes a risk factor after 55 years, increasing the probability of a chronic complication by 1.01-1.44 times.

Ross et al. published that by including all the variables of the electronic medical record, there was a decrease in its predictive performance [48]. However, this decision was recognized as a strength of the study, given that it reflected the reality of the patients [48–50]. Furthermore, we conducted the study without altering the database and without imputation of values—allowing the algorithm and accompanying techniques to study the discriminant variables for the model as recorded by physicians at the primary care level.

Additionally, in 2018, Dagliati et al. carried out a study with a similar approach to the present [51]. However, a bias was committed by not testing more than one machine learning algorithm. Moreover, before the study, they used logistic regression in a European population, which may reflect a different trend than a Hispanic population [51]. Therefore, for this case, we decided to carry out a fit test with 14 models of machine learning.

It is important to note that this study was conducted to identify risk factors for chronic complications, encompassing amputations, myocardial infarction, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy, without focusing on any particular affliction. Nevertheless, our results have generated information that supports future research aimed at the genesis of applicable instruments or strategies to benefit patients. In this sense, we must continue promoting the use of current and validated strategies and instruments for the care and prevention of complications in patients with DM, such as the determination of the degree of stiffness of the ankle, the use of the Foot Posture Index, or the use of the DFSQ, beneficial to prevent injuries or amputations of the pelvic limbs [8, 52].

We are no strangers to the wide variety of initiatives on machine learning focused on diabetes mellitus that have been launched since 2005 in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The Nordic Precision Medicine Initiative is the largest, formed in 2015, and intended to collect data from more than one million Nordic citizens [53]. Unfortunately, no publication in Mexico has included any initiative to make a comparable database. However, this project can provide a starting point for such an initiative. In addition, we demonstrate that Mexican programs already have value-rich data collection to extract insights for our Mexican patients."
10.1016/j.ijcrp.2024.200265,you,2024,"Background: The present study aimed to develop and validate a prediction nomogram model for 5-year all-cause
mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension.
Methods: Data were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A total of
3291 diabetic patients with hypertension in the NHANES cycles for 1999–2014 were selected and randomly
assigned at a ratio of 8:2 to the training cohort (n = 2633) and validation cohort (n = 658). Multivariable Cox
regression was conducted to establish a visual nomogram model for predicting the risk of 5-year all-cause
mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curves and C-indexes were used to evaluate the discriminant ability of the prediction nomogram model for all-cause mortality. Survival curves were created using the
Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.
Results: The nomogram model included eight independent predictors: age, sex, education status, marital status,
smoking, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, and previous cardiovascular disease. The C-indexes for the model
in the training and validation cohorts were 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.73–0.79, p < 0.001) and 0.75 (95%
confidence interval: 0.69–0.81, p < 0.001), respectively. The calibration curves indicated that the model had
satisfactory consistency in the two cohorts. The risk of all-cause mortality gradually increased as the tertiles of
the nomogram model score increased (log-rank test, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: The newly developed nomogram model, a readily useable and efficient tool to predict the risk of 5-
year all-cause mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension, provides a novel risk stratification method for
individualized intervention.","As one of the most common metabolic diseases, diabetes mellitus is a serious global public health concern with a large economic burden [1]. The presence of diabetes can increase the risk for all types of macrovascular disease, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke [2], as well as microvascular complications in vital organs such as the kidneys (nephropathy), eyes (retinopathy), and nervous system (neuropathy). In addition to vascular complications, diabetes can elevate all-cause mortality by increasing the risk of infection, cancer, and chronic kidney disease [3]. The interaction of diabetes and hypertension and the resulting impact on the prognosis of diabetic patients are widely known, and an intensive pharmacological approach for this population is recommended in the current guidelines [4,5]. Blood glucose and blood pressure share several pathophysiological mechanisms that clarify the coexistence of diabetes and hypertension, including insulin resistance, obesity, increased oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation [6]. It was demonstrated that the rates of both atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)-related and all-cause mortality were significantly increased in diabetic patients with hypertension compared with non-hypertensive diabetic patients [7]. Thus, accurate prediction of mortality is essential for better management of both diabetes and hypertension. Although several traditional risk factors, such as obesity, renal diseases, and dyslipidemia, were found to be associated with ASCVD onset and ASCVD-related mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension [8,9], few of these factors could effectively predict all-cause mortality.

As visual statistical prognostic tools, nomogram models are widely used for clinical risk stratification and prediction of clinical outcomes by calculating scores for potential predictors [10]. In the present study, we developed and validated a prediction nomogram model for 5-year all-cause mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a consecutive survey series on the health and nutrition status of the general population in the United States.","In the present study, we developed and validated a new nomogram model containing eight identified predictive factors to predict the risk of 5-year all-cause mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension. The prediction nomogram model had an excellent prognostic value and allowed more precise risk stratification for diabetic patients with hypertension.

Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are both major global public health problems, and their frequent coexistence results in significant morbidity and mortality. It is believed that high blood pressure can increase the risks of both all-cause death [12] and cardiovascular death [13] in patients with diabetes, and the current guidelines recommend comprehensive management of risk factors to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events [14]. Few previous studies have focused on identifying predictors of all-cause death, and an individualized and visual risk calculator for all-cause mortality was not provided. The lack of a risk stratification method for all-cause mortality is an obstacle for physicians regarding intensive intervention.

Nomogram models have been widely applied for the prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases in recent years. To effectively predict the risk of all-cause mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension, we developed a prognostic nomogram model based on NHANES data. Eight available predictors for 5-year mortality, including age, sex, education, marital status, smoke, SBP, blood urea nitrogen, and cardiovascular disease, were identified by the Cox regression model and used to construct the nomogram model. Among these predictors, age, sex, and history of cardiovascular disease have been recognized as risk factors for all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes [15]. Age has been demonstrated to be positively associated with both ASCVD-related and all-cause mortality [16] in people with diabetes, indicating that targeted anti-aging therapies may have potential to halt the progression of diabetes [17]. Both uncontrolled SBP and smoking are established risk factors for all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes [18]. A healthy lifestyle can significantly reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. Our findings indicated that long-term lifestyle management, including anti-hypertensive medication and smoking cessation, may be beneficial in diabetic patients with hypertension. Several studies have demonstrated significant associations between demographic variables and prognosis in patients with diabetes, especially socioeconomic variables. In the present study, two demographic variables, marital status and education level, were identified as parameters that can predict the risk of 5-year all-cause mortality, indicating that social support may play an important role in the clinical outcomes of both diabetes and hypertension. In a population-based study, Slåtsve et al. [19]. demonstrated that higher education levels were associated with lower odds for coronary heart disease and chronic kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and higher education was also found to affect their prognosis. The associations between marital status and health outcomes varied by sex. It was reported that the social support offered by marriage exerts a protective effect for men, but not for women [20]. However, few studies have focused on how these social factors affect the prognosis of patients with coexisting hypertension and diabetes. The present study provides a new view regarding social support for diabetes and hypertension, and more studies in this field are warranted. As the strongest biomarker predictor impacting patient prognosis in our nomogram model, serum albumin is a predominant protein in human plasma. It plays an important role in the maintenance of homeostasis, creates a balance between hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressure within vessels, and also contributes to the progression of cardiovascular diseases with its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, and anti-platelet aggregation activities [21]. Given these biological functions, serum albumin has attracted considerable attention for prediction of survival in diabetic patients in previous studies [22]. Our study demonstrated that hypoalbuminemia may be an independent predictor for all-cause mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension. Blood urea nitrogen is a protein metabolic waste product produced by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and is associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes [23]. In a recent study involving a NHANES cohort, Hong et al. found that blood urea nitrogen was an independent predictor for both cardiovascular disease-related and all-cause mortality in US adults [24]. The eight predictors in our model included a wide range of demographic characteristics, physical examination findings, and laboratory examination data, and thus the DHAM score has the potential to guide comprehensive risk factor management and assist with decision-making on medical therapy, social support, and public health.

Our study is the first to construct and validate a prognostic nomogram model for the risk of 5-year mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension. Diabetic patients with hypertension have traditionally been identified as a population at high risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause death [25]. However, few studies have focused on precise risk stratification in this population. Our scoring system provides a reliable and propagable prediction model compared with other nomogram models, and can predict the risk of all-cause death. The patients were further classified into low-, middle-, and high-risk subgroups according to the tertiles of DHAM score. Hence, the newly developed nomogram model can discriminate the patients at high risk of all-cause mortality among diabetic patients with hypertension and has the potential to provide a new approach for clinical decision-making regarding aggressive intervention.

There were several limitations to the study. First, NHANES is a multisatge, national area probability survey, with intricate sample designs and sample sizes. Our data from NHANES were not weighted [26], and it might affect the construction of prediction model. Therefore, external validation is required to confirm whether the prognostic model is suitable for different populations Second, the laboratory examination data were extracted from medical records, and thus some novel biomarkers that can predict all-cause mortality, such as interleukin-6, homocysteine, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, were not provided. Third, we utilized NHANES data from 1999 to 2014 as a complete 5-year follow-up period. To validate the prognostic value of our prediction model and perform subgroup analyses, updated data for a larger and renewed population should be employed in future studies. Despite these limitations, a predictive nomogram model was constructed that can act as a reliable and accurate risk stratification tool for all-cause mortality in diabetic patients with hypertension."
10.1186/s12944-023-01904-1,wu,2023,"Purpose:​Develop and validate a nomogram prediction model for hypertension-diabetes comorbidities based on chronic disease management in the community.

Patients and methods: The nomogram prediction model was developed in a cohort of 7200 hypertensive patients at a community health service center in Hongshan District, Wuhan City. The data were collected from January 2022 to December 2022 and randomly divided into modeling and validation groups at a 7:3 ratio. The Lasso regression model was used for data dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and clinical test feature construction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build the prediction model.

Results: The application of the nomogram in the verification group showed good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.9205 (95% CI: 0.8471-0.9527) and a good calibration effect. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the predictive model was clinically useful.

Conclusion: This study presents a nomogram prediction model that incorporates age, waist-height ratio and elevated density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-CHOLESTEROL), which can be used to predict the risk of codeveloping diabetes in hypertensive patients.","The number of chronic diseases is gradually increasing as the aging process of the population accelerates and the dietary structure of residents changes following improvements in living conditions, and chronic diseases have become the top threat to national health. ​In the Special Report of the Sixth National Health Service Statistical Survey, 48.4% of people aged 55 to 64 and 62.3% of people aged 65 and over had a chronic condition. Hypertension and diabetes are common chronic diseases with steep rates. It has been reported that the number of elderly people suffering from hypertension has reached 250 million [1], which poses a enormous challenge to the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. It has been shown that the incidence of hypertension is positively correlated with the cultural background and cognitive level of the patients, such as agricultural household registration and low cultural education, and the risk of hypertension is significantly increased, suggesting that in primary care. It is necessary to focus on the prevention and control of hypertension in rural and remote poor areas, especially for those with limited education and poor information [2].​ Another survey shows that the awareness rate of hypertension in China is only 61%, and the control rate continues to hover at a low level (< 50%). ​

Therefore, how to implement effective diversified health education for every primary care staff member is worth considering. By actively improving the awareness of residents, we can help reduce the incidence of hypertension, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases [3]. Among the administered population in this jurisdiction, the coincidence rate of hypertension and diabetes was approximately 6.04%, which was much lower than other survey results (11.25%) [4]; ​however, the coincidence rate of hypertension and diabetes was as high as 10.27% in women over 75 years of age and showed clear signatures of elevated cardiovascular disease incidence. Therefore, we should focus on dynamic glucose monitoring and health promotion and education for hypertensive patients to reduce the incidence of hypertension-diabetes comorbidities. ​The low incidence of HDC in this jurisdiction compared to the results of other studies may be related to the fact that there are four colleges and universities in this jurisdiction, and the majority of college students are healthy young adults. It may also be related to objective factors such as excess diabetes and differences in the distribution of the sample population.

​Dyslipidemia is an essential risk factor for hypertension and HDC, and enhanced daily lipid monitoring is particularly critical in this population. The risk of cardiovascular disease and death can be significantly reduced through the quantitative management of lipid levels [5]. Among the hypertensive population in China, the incidence of dyslipidemia is as high as 42.7%. However, only 20% of patients receive timely clinical treatment for dyslipidemia. The main reason is that health managers have insufficient understanding of the correlation between dyslipidemia and chronic disease progression and have no active awareness of monitoring blood lipids in daily chronic disease management [6]. ​Therefore, we need to not only strengthen normal health education in high-risk groups with dyslipidemia but also monitor the dynamic changes in blood lipids and implement effective lipid management in a timely manner to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

A common feature of prehypertensive patients and prediabetic patients is insulin resistance, and insulin resistance is an early stage that can develop into two different diseases [7]. Studies have shown that obesity is the main cause of insulin resistance [8]. In foreign countries, most current research has focused on the correlation between obesity indicators and individual hypertension or diabetes. Domestic reports have shown a positive correlation between obesity indicators and HDC. For example, Liu et al. studied 10,431 adults in some areas of Jiangsu and Anhui, Fu et al. focused on adults in Beijing, and Xie et al. studied 24,792 residents in Chongqing who were 40 years old and concluded that obesity increased the risk of HDC. Garrow et al. proposed that the use of BMI to predict obesity has limitations on the risk of cardiovascular diseases [9]. ​Although the indicator WHtR is not widely used, it is more accurate than BMI and WC in predicting HDC risk. The findings of this study suggest that BMI and WHtR are independent factors in the risk of hypertension-diabetes comorbidity.

Based on the above, it is necessary to include BMI, WC, WHtR and other indicators in the analysis of influencing factors of the HDC of residents in jurisdictions, use a new method to describe the change trajectory of their respective association intensity with the HDC of residents in jurisdictions, and further analyze their relationship with the HDC of residents in jurisdictions to judge their respective prediction efficiency of the HDC risk of residents in jurisdictions. It would also be of strong practical interest if the population studied were targeted at the residents of the jurisdiction.

Nomogram prediction models are methods used to assess the probability of occurrence of certain diseases. Due to its superior reliability, it has been widely used in cancer and other research fields [10–12]. It can not only predict the risk of disease occurrence and gain time for early clinical intervention but also reduce medical costs for patients and maximize the benefits of diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, this study developed an effective and reliable HDC nomogram prediction model to understand the basic information and clinical characteristics of hypertension and diabetes among residents of a district in Hongshan, Wuhan.

This study aims to achieve the following objectives:

(1) To determine the relationship between BMI, WC and WHtR of residents in the jurisdiction and HDC while controlling for as many confounding factors as possible;

(2) The dose‒response relationship between BMI, WC and WHtR and HDC was described for residents of different sexes and ages.

(3) Construct the HDC prediction model of district residents based on BMI, WC and WHtR and other factors and obtain the prediction efficiency of BMI, WC and WHtR;

(4) The direct effect of obesity on the HDC of residents in the jurisdiction was obtained, and the mediating effect size in the relationship between sociodemographic factors, lifestyle and HDC was obtained.

This study is expected to explore the relationship between BMI, WC, WHtR and HDC among residents of the jurisdiction from multiple perspectives. The results of this study can provide theoretical guidance for the prevention of HDC and encourage people to improve their lifestyle, focus on weight and WC control, and reduce the burden of the disease.","We developed and validated a clinical model for predicting hypertension-diabetes comorbidities for the community management of chronic diseases, which is composed of clinical risk factors readily available in community management. First, 13 clinical risk indicators were identified as independent risk factors through a single-factor analysis of 22 clinical features. ​Due to the possible multicollinear relationship between these risk factors, LASSO regression analysis was used to screen the five predictors with nonzero coefficients from the 13 variables as independent variables for multifactor regression analysis, resulting in three predictors as independent risk factors. The above independent risk factors were then applied to construct a predictive model, which was visualized by constructing a nomogram. The results demonstrate that the established predictive model is well stabilized in both the modeling and validation groups and that the clinical trial nomogram has the potential to be used as a chronic disease management tool for predicting hypertension-diabetes comorbidities in the community.

In terms of clinical features, we found that age and waist-height ratio were independent risk factors for hypertension-diabetes comorbidity, which is also consistent with numerous other findings [17–19]. Among the three potential clinical risk factors, HDL-C level has always been considered a clinical indicator closely related to hypertensive-diabetes comorbidity [17]. This study has shown that low HDL-C levels are an influential predictor of codeveloping diabetes in patients with hypertension, and the reason why HDL-C can reduce the risk of diabetes may be that HDL-C can activate the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway in fat, skeletal muscle and calories, thereby promoting glucose uptake in various peripheral tissues. In vitro experiments have shown that HDL-C can inhibit oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of islet B cells [18]. The functional deficiency of HDL-C can lead to increased sensitivity of islet B cells to oxidative stress and lead to islet inflammation and cholesterol accumulation [19]. At the same time, this study also found that the internal change trend of HDL-C levels over time was slightly different among different individuals, which also revealed that predicting the occurrence of diabetes comorbidity based only on the HDL-C level at baseline or at a certain point may ignore the influence of the continuous change trajectory of HDL-C on diabetes comorbidity. ​The above findings broaden our thinking for additional studies at a later stage. Among the hypertensive population in China, the incidence of dyslipidemia is as high as 42.7%. However, only 20% of patients receive timely clinical treatment for dyslipidemia. The main reason is that health managers do not have an adequate understanding of the correlation between talent and chronic disease progression and do not have an active awareness of monitoring blood lipids in routine chronic disease management. Therefore, we need to not only strengthen normal health education in high-risk groups with dyslipidemia but also monitor the dynamic changes in blood lipids and implement effective lipid management in a timely manner to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.​

​In addition, this study attempted to explore additional clinical information on obesity indicators. Studies in the United States and abroad have evaluated the efficacy of WC and WHtR in the diagnosis of abdominal obesity by comparing their association with cardiovascular disease. Hseih et al. found that WHtR was better than WC in evaluating abdominal obesity in the Japanese population [20]. However, there is a large difference in the distribution of WC between men and women [21]. ​Therefore, it is appropriate and reasonable to include BMI, WC and WHtR in the selection of obesity assessment metrics in this study. We utilized the minimal absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method and found no statistical correlation between elevated WC and HDC. This is at odds with the conclusions of previous studies. Perhaps the most important reason for this discrepancy is that both WHtR and WC are included as independent variables in the analysis. The two independent variables, WC and WHtR, are correlated, and the degree of correlation between them reaches the multicollinearity criterion. Another possible reason is that the nodal splitting of normal and abnormal WC in this study is different from other domestic and international studies. This suggests the importance of obesity control in HDC prevention interventions, which can be based on demographic and sociological characteristics of the population, health knowledge, lifestyle and other targeted measures.

Study strengths and limitations
This study not only analyzed the basic sociological information of the patients, but also explored the characteristics of the test omics, so as to obtain a simple and easily available predictor. In this study, five nonzero coefficient predictors were selected from 13 selected variables using the minimally absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method. Moreover, the nonlinear dose–response relationship between WHtR and HDC was found in this study. In the elderly population, the intensity of the association between HDC and WHtR initially increased with the increase of WHtR, but this trend was not unchanged, showing a certain ""saturation effect"". To facilitate clinical application, this study constructs a clinical test-omics nomogram that combines test-omics features with available clinical features.

The limitations of this study are as follows: (1) The results of this study come from a single institution; therefore, multicenter verification is needed to expand the universality of the experimental results. (2) This study is a retrospective study, and there may be inevitable selection bias. In summary, this study establishes a clinical-lab nomogram that can be used as a clinical tool for individualized hypertension-diabetes comorbidities to assist clinical treatment decision-making and enable precision medicine."
10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e38124,mao,2024,"Objective
Multimorbidity, particularly diabetes combined with hypertension (DCH), is a significant public health concern. Currently, there is a gap in research utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict hypertension risk in Chinese middle-aged and elderly diabetic patients, and gender differences in DCH comorbidity patterns remain unclear. We aimed to use ML algorithms to predict DCH and identify its determinants among middle-aged and elderly diabetic patients in China.
Study design
Cross-sectional study.
Methods
Data were collected on 2775 adults with diabetes aged ≥45 years from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. We employed nine ML algorithms to develop prediction models for DCH. The performance of these models was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, we conducted variable importance analysis to identify key determinants.
Results
Our results showed that the best prediction models for the overall population, men, and women were extreme gradient boosting (AUC = 0.728), light gradient boosting machine (AUC = 0.734), and random forest (AUC = 0.737), respectively. Age, waist circumference, body mass index, creatinine level, triglycerides, taking Western medicine, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and sleep disorders were identified as common important predictors by all three populations.
Conclusions
ML algorithms showed accurate predictive capabilities for DCH. Overall, non-linear ML models outperformed traditional logistic regression for predicting DCH. DCH predictions exhibited variations in predictors and model accuracy by gender. These findings could help identify DCH early and inform the development of personalized intervention strategies.","Diabetes and hypertension are prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, with an increasing incidence. The International Diabetes Federation anticipates a global prevalence of diabetes to reach 12.2 % (783.7 million) by 2045 [1]. From 1990 to 2019, the number of hypertension cases surged from 650 million to 1.3 billion globally [2]. Approximately 1.28 billion adults aged 30 to 79 suffer from hypertension worldwide [3]. China has the highest number of diabetic patients globally [4]. The prevalence and risk of diabetes escalate significantly after the age of 45, and this trend is expected to continue as the population ages [5,6]. It is estimated that over 50 % of diabetics also have hypertension, which accelerates the progression of nephropathy and worsens diabetes symptoms [7]. Diabetes combined with hypertension (DCH) significantly elevates the risk of cardiovascular diseases and poses a substantial socioeconomic burden [8]. Hence, early identification and intervention of DCH is essential to improve the prognosis of patients with diabetes and reduce the incidence of serious complications.
One of the global targets for non-communicable diseases is to reduce the prevalence of hypertension by 33 % between 2010 and 2030 [3]. Efficiently controlling hypertension among middle-aged and elderly adults with diabetes and accurately predicting DCH are crucial for advancing toward this goal. In recent years, the advent of artificial intelligence has spurred the widespread application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in clinical research [9]. Compared to traditional statistical methods, ML algorithms excel at handling intricate nonlinear relationships, interactions, and multiple covariates, significantly bolstering the predictive power of the models [10]. As such, ML algorithms can be utilized to improve prediction accuracy and support early intervention strategies, thereby effectively managing hypertension in diabetic patients.
Despite this, there is still an absence of DCH prediction models for Chinese middle-aged and elderly diabetic patients. Previous studies have predominantly employed logistic regression (LR) models and Cox regression methods to construct prediction models for DCH, demonstrating good predictive performance [11–15]. Furthermore, some studies have focused on exploring predictors [16–18], while others have reported using ML algorithms to predict DCH. For instance, a study in the United Arab Emirates successfully predicted eight diabetic complications, including hypertension, using the random forest model (AUC = 0.736) [19]. Moreover, another study involving 164 diabetic patients in Massachusetts, United States of America, utilized liquid biomarkers to predict DCH, with the linear discriminant analysis classifier achieving the highest accuracy rate of 61.2 % [20]. Additionally, a study based on 2080 diabetic patients from Qingdao, China, established a DCH prediction model incorporating blood pressure as a predictor, with an AUC exceeding 0.9 [21]. Among these, two studies [19,20] were conducted in other countries, and one focused on Chinese individuals aged 12–83 years [21]. However, there has not been an ML algorithm prediction study of DCH covering the characteristics of Chinese middle-aged and elderly adults. Additionally, research investigating gender differences in both predictors and predictive accuracy of DCH models is scarce. Existing evidence suggests that men generally have higher blood pressure levels than age-matched premenopausal women, while women often experience an increase in blood pressure after menopause [22,23]. This gender-based variation warrants further exploration to enhance the precision and applicability of DCH prediction models.
Our study aimed to develop predictive models for DCH using nine ML algorithms: LR, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting machine (GBM), gaussian naive bayes (GNB), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), RF, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor classification (KNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Additionally, we aimed to identify key factors influencing DCH and explore variations in model performance and significant predictors among different gender groups. These findings have the potential to deepen our insights into DCH pathogenesis, while also informing gender-specific personalized medical recommendations and hypertension management strategies for diabetics, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for diabetics.","We used ML algorithms to predict DCH in middle-aged and elderly Chinese diabetic patients, based on self-reported questions, physical examination, and blood biomarker data. Our findings showed that ML algorithms could accurately predict DCH among middle-aged and elderly adults. Our study also investigated gender-specific variations in predictors and model performance for predicting DCH. We found that there were gender-specific variations in predictors and model accuracy.
Our results demonstrated that the AdaBoost, RF, KNN, GBM, LGBM, and XGBoost models surpassed the LR model in accurately predicting DCH. Overall, non-linear models outperformed linear models, suggesting that non-linear models will be more effective in identifying DCH in clinical settings. This contrasts sharply with Jadhav's study [20], which relied solely on biomarker data and did not fully leverage the capabilities of nonlinear models in handling more complex datasets. Our study emphasizes the advantages of non-linear models. However, our exploration did not include ensemble modeling, a technique that combines predictions from various models to potentially enhance predictive performance [38]. Whether ensemble models are superior and whether the models presented in our study are effective in clinical practice requires further validation. Although the current study was conducted in a Chinese population, similar model development approaches can provide valuable technical insights for predicting DCH across different ethnic groups.
Our study had several advantages. Firstly, in terms of predictors, we acknowledged the significant impact of hypoglycemic medication on the development of hypertension in diabetic patients, which has been overlooked in previous DCH prediction models [[19], [20], [21]]. Our dataset included the use of hypoglycemic medications, categorized into traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine, and insulin. Moreover, we conducted separate evaluations to assess the impacts of these treatments on hypertension. This consideration not only provides more comprehensive information but also has the potential to guide the development of personalized and precise prevention strategies. Secondly, unlike the previous study [21], our research did not incorporate blood pressure data, enabling an examination of hypertension-related factors independent of blood pressure. This approach fosters a deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying hypertension. Thirdly, subgroup analyses focus on prediction models for different gender groups, while also elucidating gender-specific differences in predictors. As expected, the LGBM demonstrated superior predictive performance for men, while the RF model performed better for women. However, previous studies have not addressed potential gender-based differences in prediction.
We found that age, waist circumference, BMI, creatinine level, triglycerides, HDL-C, blood urea nitrogen, taking Western medicine, sleep disorders, total cholesterol, and LDL-C were important predictors of DCH. These findings align with previous studies [11,13,15], where age, BMI, waist circumference, creatinine level, and hypoglycemic medication were associated with DCH. Future research could further explore the association and mechanism between hypoglycemic drugs and DCH. Guo et al. [39] found that lipid levels were strongly associated with the occurrence of hypertension. Specifically, abnormal blood lipid levels result in reduced nitric oxide synthesis, leading to impaired vasoconstriction and relaxation and abnormally high blood pressure [40]. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on dietary management for diabetic patients to control lipid levels. Abnormal creatinine levels indicate the severity of kidney damage, which may be exacerbated by diabetes. Furthermore, renal dysfunction is intricately tied to both the onset and progression of hypertension [41]. Sleep disorders stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, increasing its activity. Overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to accelerated heart rate, vasoconstriction, and subsequent blood pressure elevation [42]. Multiple studies have shown that insufficient sleep duration increases the risk of hypertension [43,44]. Our analysis also revealed some novel findings: age emerged as the most important predictor in both the overall and women's populations, while it is the second most important in the men's subgroup. Despite there being no statistically significant age disparity between genders in our initial analysis, this discrepancy hints at an intricate interplay between age and diverse factors that may vary by gender. To unravel these complexities, future research could explore the interactions between age and other predictors, accounting for biological nuances such as hormonal differences, which may modulate the impact of age on DCH risk in a gender-specific manner. We hypothesize that one reason for this gender difference could be the younger baseline age of men in our study compared to women. Additionally, BMI was the most influential predictor of DCH among men, whereas it only ranked third in importance for women. This may be related to male-specific physiological characteristics and metabolic pathways, which increase men's sensitivity to weight-related metabolic risks [45,46]. In addition, men and women often face different societal expectations and pressures related to body image and weight management, which can influence their health behaviors and ultimately their risk for DCH. This suggests a greater need for focusing on men's weight management to prevent DCH. Furthermore, alcohol drinking and smoking were crucial modifiable predictors specific to men, whereas depression and body pain were significant modifiable predictors specific to women. Previous studies have shown that men consume alcohol and smoke at much higher rates than women [47], and women are more likely to develop psychiatric disorders and experience insomnia compared to men [48,49]. Our findings may contribute to better identification of high-risk populations for DCH and suggest the need for gender-specific intervention strategies. Men should prioritize controlling their alcohol consumption and smoking, as well as improving their weight management. Meanwhile, women should focus on mental health and pain management to effectively reduce the risk for DCH."
 10.1109/JBHI.2017.2765639,Zarkogianni,2017,The estimation of long-term diabetes complications risk is essential in the process of medical decision making. Guidelines for the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) advocate calculating the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk to initiate appropriate treatment. The objective of this study is to investigate the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques toward the development of personalized models able to predict the risk of fatal or nonfatal CVD incidence in T2DM patients. The important challenge of handling the unbalanced nature of the available dataset is addressed by applying novel ensemble strategies. Hybrid Wavelet Neural Networks (HWNNs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) constitute the primary models for building ensembles following a subsampling approach. Different methods for combining the decisions of the primary models are applied and comparatively assessed. Data from the 5-year follow up of 560 patients with T2DM are used for development and evaluation purposes. The highest discrimination performance (Area Under the Curve (AUC): 71.48%) is achieved by taking into account both the HWNN- and SOM- based primary models' outputs. The proposed method is superior to the Binomial Linear Regression (BLR) model justifying the need to apply more sophisticated techniques in order to produce reliable CVD risk scores.,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes affecting 90% of people with diabetes worldwide. Optimal management of T2DM requires a deep understanding of the predisposing factors associated with the disease, early diagnosis and treatment before the occurrence of complications, and tight glycemic control. Early identification of patients at an increased risk of developing diabetes complications is of utmost importance to select appropriate treatment.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most serious long-term diabetes complication being the major cause of death in people with diabetes, accounting for 50% or more of all diabetes fatalities and severe disabilities. Mortality rates due to CVD in patients with T2DM are 2–4 times higher than the corresponding ones in patients without diabetes.

Taking into account that the medical treatment of CVD related risk factors reduces the occurrence of CVD, along with the increased prevalence of CVD and its economic burden, clinical practice guidelines focus on primary prevention and recommend care givers to evaluate patients for CVD risk factors that may warrant medical treatment [1]. However, it has been shown that care providers cannot estimate the CVD risk on their own [1]. Thus, computational models able to predict the CVD risk can provide valuable tools for treatment planning/selection. International guidelines for T2DM management advocate estimating the CVD risk to initiate appropriate treatment [2], [3].

The European Association for the study of Diabetes (EASD) recommends using FRAMINGHAM [4] and DECODE [5] as preferred prediction models for calculating the CVD risk. However, these models are applicable to the general population and underestimate the risk in diabetes patients [6], [7]. On the other hand, International Diabetes Federation guidelines recommend using the UKPDS risk engine [8] which is dedicated to the T2DM population, but results in varying discriminative performance (c-statistic: 65%–86%) and poor calibration. The methodologies used for the development of these risk engines, are usually based on survival analysis (e.g., cox hazard regression) and regression equations.

In general, a variety of methodologies in the area of statistics and machine learning, such as logistic regression, decision trees, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and Bayesian networks have been applied towards the development of computational models to predict clinical outcomes [8] –​[14]. Among these, logistic regression and ANNs gained the most widespread acceptance in the field of risk prediction models, due to their simplicity and good predictive ability. ANNs are particularly useful for capturing complex relationships in the data and have been successfully applied in several domains of medical diagnosis and prognosis. A hybrid decision support system for the risk assessment of retinopathy development in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus has been proposed [9], [14]. The system has been based on the combined use of a back-propagated Feed forward Neural Network (FFN), a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and a Hybrid Wavelet Neural Network (HWNN). The three primary classifiers have been comparatively assessed and the superiority of the HWNN over both CART and FNN has been demonstrated. Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) constitute another class of ANNs that has been extensively used in a variety of applications for clustering and classification purposes. However, limited SOM-based models have been proposed for assisting disease prognosis and diagnosis [15]–​[19]. Recently, the use of SOM has been investigated for the diagnosis of DM [18] as well as diabetic neuropathy [19].

A major issue that is frequently encountered in the field of diagnosing a disease or predicting disease risks is the unbalanced nature of the available medical data [20]. Several techniques have been developed to overcome this problem, such as under- and over –sampling, cost-sensitive learning, and ensemble learning [21].

The present study aims at applying and comparatively assessing sophisticated machine learning techniques towards the development of personalized risk prediction models for the fatal or non-fatal CVD incidence in T2DM, focusing on Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and Stroke. Taking as input CVD related risk factors, the proposed models output the 5-year risk score for a T2DM patient to experience a CVD incidence for the first time. HWNNs’ and SOMs’ classification and regression abilities have motivated their application in the present work. In order to handle the unbalanced nature of the data, novel ensemble learning approaches have been deployed. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work proposing the use of HWNNs and SOMs to calculate the CVD risk in T2DM. The performance of the proposed models has been assessed against a Binomial Linear Regression (BLR) model which has been chosen due to its simplicity and wide usage towards the development of risk prediction models [22]. Moreover, a comparison with commonly used machine learning techniques for the development of CVD risk prediction models in T2DM has been conducted.","Existing CVD risk prediction models in T2DM are mainly based on advanced statistics. In the present study, the use of advanced machine learning approaches was investigated and compared with the SoA justifying the need to apply more sophisticated techniques towards producing reliable CVD risk scores. The proposed ensembles of HWNNs and SOMs addressed the commonly encountered challenge of handling the unbalanced nature of the available datasets as well as issues associated with the complex interactions and nonlinearities inherent in diabetes related data.

The deployment and comparison of several combination schemes towards the creation of the ensembles highlighted the increased effectiveness of the advanced combination schemes against simpler ones, with respect to the ensembles’ discriminative ability. Moreover, the SOM- based ensembles’ superiority over the HWNN-based ensembles was shown. The combined use of both ensembles (hybrid ensemble) further improved the overall performance, which was attributed to the diversity among the members of the ensemble.

Evidence regarding the hybrid ensemble's potential to produce more reliable CVD risk scores than those reported in the literature was provided. The comparison between the results obtained by applying the 10-fold cross validation to evaluate the hybrid ensemble's performance and those reported in the literature, which, in most cases, were produced following the split sampling validation method, illustrated the higher generalization capabilities of the hybrid ensemble over the existing CVD risk prediction models for patients with T2DM. Moreover, the application of the UKPDS risk engine on the Hippokration dataset resulted in lower discrimination performance than the hybrid ensemble. In order to provide a fair comparison with the SoA, commonly used statistics (e.g., BLR) and machine learning strategies (e.g., FFN, CART, Random Forest, and Naïve Bayes) were applied and evaluated on the Hippokration dataset. The obtained results indicated the hybrid ensemble's ability to produce more accurate CVD risk scores.

Although the main scope of the present study was to provide evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning techniques and not to propose a final CVD risk prediction model to be used in clinical practice, the hybrid ensemble's clinical assessment highlighted its potential to support clinical decision making. Furthermore, its usability was ensured since it only required information from patients’ medical history and easily available laboratory tests.

Potential limitations of the present study refer to the nature of the used dataset and the increased inherent complexity of the proposed models. Particularly, data corresponding to homogeneous population in terms of race and ethnicity were used for development and evaluation purposes. This was beneficial to the proposed models as compared to the UKPDS risk engine, which was built based on data corresponding to cohorts of T2DM patients with larger variance regarding their race/ethnicity and validated on the population used in this study. Furthermore, the proposed machine learning approaches were characterized by higher complexity than logistic and cox hazard regression, making thus the representation of each risk factor's impact and interpretation of the predicted outputs more difficult.

Future work concerns the validation of the proposed methods on datasets of larger size and heterogeneity with the ultimate goal to provide a well validated CVD risk prediction model to be adopted in clinical practice. The integration of the model into a web-based medical decision support system that provides user-friendliness though interfaces incorporating simplified charts and tables, is expected to facilitate the interpretation of the results."
10.1007/s10916-019-1479-y,Rafael Garcia-Carretero,2019,"Few studies have addressed the predictive value of arterial stiffness determined by pulse wave velocity (PWV) in a high-risk population with no prevalent cardiovascular disease and with obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and preserved kidney function. This longitudinal, retrospective study enrolled 88 high-risk patients and had a follow-up time of 12.4 years. We collected clinical and laboratory data, as well as information on arterial stiffness parameters using arterial tonometry and measurements from ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We considered nonfatal, incident cardiovascular events as the primary outcome. Given the small size of our dataset, we used survival analysis (i.e., Cox proportional hazards model) combined with a machine learning-based algorithm/penalization method to evaluate the data. Our predictive model, calculated with Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), included body mass index, diabetes mellitus, gender (male), and PWV. We recorded 16 nonfatal cardiovascular events (5 myocardial infarctions, 5 episodes of heart failure, and 6 strokes). The adjusted hazard ratio for PWV was 1.199 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.37, p < 0.001). Arterial stiffness was a predictor of cardiovascular disease development, as determined by PWV in a high-risk population. Thus, in obese, hypertensive, hyperglycemic patients with preserved kidney function, PWV can serve as a prognostic factor for major adverse cardiac events.","Traditionally, office blood pressure (BP) measurements from the brachial artery have been key to establishing a diagnosis of essential hypertension, and therefore, the assessment of cardiovascular risk [1]. Recently, alternative methods for assessing BP such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or the measurement of intermediate markers, such as kidney function or arterial stiffness, have also been used to assess cardiovascular risk [2, 3]. These alternative markers of end-organ damage may more accurately assess cardiovascular risk in certain high-risk populations [4].

Arterial stiffness is an intermediate marker that can be measured using noninvasive methods, either with tonometry or oscillometry. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the augmentation index of aortic pressure (AIx) are indicators of arterial stiffness. These parameters are an alternative and more accurate marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than conventional brachial BP, because they evaluate not only arterial stiffness but also underlying arteriosclerosis [4]. Elevated values of PWV are correlated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in certain populations [5] including the elderly [6], individuals with diabetes mellitus [7], hypertensive patients [8], and patients with impaired kidney function [9]. However, there is lack of evidence regarding the predictive value of PWV, AIx, standard clinical parameters, or ABPM in patients at high risk for incident CVD with no previous cardiovascular events, such as obese, hypertensive, hyperglycemic patients with preserved kidney function, i.e., patients with preclinical CVD. Because there is no validated multivariate prediction model for these patients, PWV measurement has not been widely used in an outpatient setting for risk assessment or the evaluation of arterial stiffness.

The goal of this study was to develop a predictive model in which the assessment of arterial stiffness by either PWV or AIx was included, along with ABPM and standard clinical parameters, to better assess cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.","This study investigated the predictive value of several parameters determined in an outpatient setting to assess the risk for CVD, specifically the role of PWV for evaluation of a high-risk population. The main finding was that PWV was an independent prognostic factor in the development of nonfatal, incident cardiovascular events, unlike other parameters such as AIx, office brachial BP, or measurements from ABPM. Therefore, PWV can be used to predict future cardiovascular events in a high-risk population in which other established cardiovascular risk factors are not predictive. The predictive value of PWV was stronger than gender, T2DM, and BMI in our patients.

The optimal approach for cardiovascular risk assessment in certain populations such as the elderly, obese, or hypertensive patients has been a subject of debate when traditional risk factors are measured [28]. Risk stratification may be improved with the introduction of novel markers, especially those that can determine end-organ damage such as arterial stiffness [4]. Left ventricular hypertrophy or urinary albumin excretion are relatively easy to obtain in clinical practice, and have demonstrated utility in risk stratification in subclinical CVD [29, 30]. However, determining arterial stiffness is not a routine measurement in an outpatient clinical setting, so its utility may be debatable.

In the last several years, arterial stiffness has been considered an intermediate marker of end-organ damage, and can be assessed through PWV measurement [31]. Several cross-sectional studies have confirmed the association between PWV and cardiovascular events [32, 33], so PWV may be an attractive intermediate marker in routine clinical practice.

It is worth noting that several predictors had spurious effects when univariate Cox analyses were performed (e.g., HDL-C as a risk factor, office-based BP as a protective factor). This may seem counterintuitive. However, we propose that the main disadvantage of univariate classical Cox regression analysis is the violation of the proportional hazards assumption, which may result in a false inference [34]. Fortunately, multivariate LASSO-Cox analysis overcomes that issue. As stated by Ojeda et al [35], penalized methods such as LASSO provide reliable prognostic models and variable selection at the same time. Noisy predictors may have a spurious effect on datasets with a small number of events. Thus, the use of penalization methods is recommended for actual data applications due to their reliable predictive accuracy, feature selection, and low selection bias [36].

In our study, we also used RF to evaluate feature importance: each individual feature has its own importance, which is essentially a measure of how well the model performs when any given feature is excluded. RF was used not only to accurately predict MACE but also to optimize the identification of the most important features for predicting cardiovascular events among our patients.

One of the strengths of our study was that it included a high-risk population that lacked prevalent CVD but had subclinical end-organ damage. When developing our predictive model, obesity (determined via BMI), gender (male), T2DM, and PWV were the most relevant predictive factors for developing MACE, although PWV was identified as the most relevant predictor. Other measurements such as the use of laboratory markers, standard clinical features, and parameters obtained in an ABPM were considered irrelevant. This confirms that in a high-risk population, standard parameters may not be useful to properly estimate future MACEs. AIx, an alternative measurement of arterial stiffness, was excluded from the model and was not associated with the primary outcome in univariate analyses, demonstrating that AIx is not interchangeable with PWV when evaluating cardiovascular risk.

Regarding the selected variables in our predictive model, although BMI and T2DM were statistically significant, their contribution to the model did not seem as relevant as PWV, probably because our patients were hyperglycemic and obese or overweight [37]. This patient profile can make discrimination difficult because such patients are already at high risk for future cardiovascular events.

Also, the effects of drugs could not be assessed. Based on our data, we can only conclude that BP was well controlled in our patients. Therefore, the roles of such drugs in modifying the structure of arteries and remodeling their walls [31, 38] in our population remain unclear.

Another strength of our study was that it evaluated the role of PWV in survival analysis to establish a longitudinal relationship, rather than a mere statistical correlation in a cross-sectional study. Our results suggest that PWV may improve risk stratification in selected populations and may be a therapeutic target in management strategies. The predictive value of PWV also provides insight into the role of arterial stiffness, which will be helpful in future studies that investigate the underlying mechanisms of CVD.

A third strength was that we used machine learning-based approaches (i.e., penalization methods, RF) to address the issue of both a small dataset and low EPV ratio. We chose LASSO regression with the Cox survival model to obtain a limited number of predictors (i.e., a more parsimonious model). In a clinical setting, a model with few predictors is desirable due to limitations of resources and time to obtain information from patients. Another advantage of penalization approaches is that they address overfitting better than conventional survival analyses in which a limited number of events is available, and as such, are more reliable. By combining classical statistical methods, LASSO, and RF (or other machine learning techniques), one can see that in certain situations, such as when working with high-dimensional datasets, scarce data, or databases with a low number of events, the removal of irrelevant features has no impact on performance because they introduce noise. This empirical observation could be of interest when studying the actual importance of selected features, such as PWV.

Limitations
Our study had several limitations. The main limitation was the small sample size and the small number of events. Another limitation was the inherent disadvantages of a retrospective study. The study also lacked a validation cohort for external validation. In addition, the high-risk profile of our patients (hypertensive, obese, hyperglycemic) could have yielded potential confounders, resulting in bias. Unlike other studies on cardiovascular risk assessment, smoking status was not included as a variable because data on this factor were not correctly obtained from patients. Likewise, we found discrepancies when studying the effect of gender. We observed a 68% incidence in male gender. However, it seems to be a non-significant predictive factor, if we observe the low effect of male gender on the development of a MACE, i.e., the observed low hazard ratio may not be clinically significant. Furthermore, RF determined the low importance of gender in the final predictive model. Also, the effects of medications on PWV could not be assessed. Drugs were prescribed to treat arterial hypertension and other conditions (T2DM, dyslipidemia), so their effects on the dependent variable could not be adequately estimated via a regression model. All of these limitations were fully taken into consideration when choosing the appropriate statistical approach. Although our results are not novel, developing a prediction model with survival analysis and using machine learning-based methods to perform the analyses strengthens previous findings on the role of PWV in predicting future cardiovascular events.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.health.2023.100219,Anurag Shrivastava,2023,"Hypertension describes elevated blood pressure, which significantly impacts cardiovascular diseases. Typically, a sphygmomanometer, a cuff-like device, is used to measure a patient’s blood pressure. However, new techniques such as phonocardiogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) based on cuff signals have been developed. Still, they require complex and expensive multiple sensors. A new machine learning-based method has been proposed to predict both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to overcome this issue. The model considers various clinical characteristics such as gender, blood sugar and cholesterol levels, smoking status, age, alcohol use, weight, and a history of heart disease. A physical activity level metric is used to evaluate the model trained on a dataset of 50,000 blood pressure readings available on Kaggle. Four machine learning techniques, including 
-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, were tested with different training, validation, and testing ratios to enhance the model’s accuracy. The algorithm’s performance was evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores. Random forest was found to have the highest accuracy and F1 scores.","High blood pressure is associated with chronic diseases such as acute kidney infections, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular problems, and strokes, but lifestyle modifications such as reducing stress and improving exercise quality and quantity can lower its incidence [1]. Early diagnosis or prediction of high blood pressure is crucial to prevent side effects such as fatigue, confusion, and chest, neck, and ear pain [2]. Risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, inactivity, obesity, high cholesterol, age, sex, race, and ethnicity must be considered for effective management [3]. Despite the low proportion of people affected, healthcare providers may struggle to address hypertension [4]. Predicting systolic and diastolic blood pressures using machine learning involves utilizing algorithms to analyze datasets to identify factors that contribute to high blood pressure as depicted in Fig. 1. These algorithms can be trained on a wide range of data sources, such as clinical databases, ECG data, fingertip oximeter data, and patient data from nearby hospitals [5]. Various machine learning algorithms can be used, including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) [6], Gaussian Composite Regression [7] in Online Extremely Recurrent Machine Learning (OR-ELM) [8], and process regression [9]. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific dataset and the research question being addressed [10]. To ensure accurate predictions, datasets must be carefully prepared by clearing extraneous information and filling in any missing values [11]. The accuracy of the predictions can be evaluated using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and 
-fold cross-validation [12]. Overall, utilizing machine learning to predict blood pressure could lead to earlier diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and more personalized treatment plans for patients [13].
2. Related work
The use of smartphone apps and machine learning algorithms for early diagnosis and prediction of cardiovascular disease, specifically hypertension, has been a topic of interest in research [9], [14], [15], [16]. Researcher suggests that a smartphone app displaying historical and projected data can aid in the early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. However, the specific details and context of Ken Martin’s recommendation are not mentioned.
To predict hypertension, researchers proposed using a customized machine learning model called Gaussian Composite Regression in Online Extremely Recurrent Machine Learning (OR-ELM). This model involves filling in missing values and using Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) to predict hypertension. The dataset is then processed using OR-ELM for 24 h. It was found that the risk of heart disease increases significantly when the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is over 115 mm Hg. Prehypertension risk was observed after analyzing 4484 adult records [17].
Patient blood pressure and ECG data were used to predict hypertension using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. ANN classifiers provided more accurate predictions than SVMs after training on the dataset. Hsieh et al. developed a linear regression model that utilized human Pulse Transit Time (PTT) to predict high and low blood pressure. The model’s predictions for high pressure were reasonably accurate, but there is room for improvement in accuracy [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26].","The proposed approach involves obtaining raw data from Kaggle, which includes various health-related information about individuals such as their age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, physical activity level, alcohol intake, and cardiac history. To begin, the data is imported into Collab and preprocessed, removing any invalid inputs and extracting important entities to simplify the dataset. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be used to classify patients into one of four hypertension groups. The data is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. This approach can be extended to other chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and diabetes.
The addition of matching values in the dataset was necessary to address incorrect records and missing entries, ensuring data integrity and completeness. The shape of the dataset, referring to the number of rows and columns, was defined to facilitate data analysis and manipulation. To gain insights from the dataset, bar charts and box charts were used to visually represent the distribution of data for each element, allowing for a better understanding of the data characteristics. To expedite the learning process and improve computational efficiency, certain features were removed from the dataset. Feature selection is a common practice in machine learning to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant attributes for prediction. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training the models and 20% reserved for evaluating their performance.
During the training phase, four different machine learning algorithms were employed: 
-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. These algorithms were trained on the training set and then evaluated on the testing set to measure their performance. The performance of the classifiers was compared using various metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. Figs. 11, 12, 13, and 14 likely represent visualizations of the performance metrics for the different classifiers.
The results of the evaluation demonstrated that the random forest classifier outperformed the other three classifiers in terms of accuracy and computation time. This indicates that the random forest algorithm provided more accurate predictions and had a faster computation time compared to KNN, logistic regression, and decision trees. Based on these findings, the proposed approach using the random forest classifier can be considered superior for the given dataset and problem. The approach shows potential for application in treating other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, by adapting the methodology to the specific characteristics and data requirements of those diseases. It is important to note that the generalizability of the results and the suitability of the approach for other chronic illnesses would require further validation and exploration in separate studies."

This study designed a visualization risk prediction system based on Machine Learning and SHAP as an auxiliary tool for personalized health management of hypertension. We used ten Machine Learning algorithms such as random forests and 1617 anonymized health check data to build ten hypertension risk prediction models. The model performance was evaluated through indicators such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROC curve. We used the best-performing model combined with the SHAP algorithm for feature importance analysis and built a visualization risk prediction system on the web page. The LightGMB model exhibited the best predictive performance, and age, alkaline phosphatase, and triglycerides were important features for predicting the risk of hypertension. Users can obtain their risk probability of hypertension and determine the focus of intervention through the visualization system built on the web page. Our research helps doctors and patients to develop personalized prevention and intervention programs for hypertension based on health check data, which has significant clinical and public health significance.","Hypertension as a common and serious health problem worldwide, is a crucial risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke1,2,3. In China, the population of hypertension patients has exceeded 200 million, and the number is growing at a rate of 10 million per year4,5. Early intervention and control can significantly reduce the incidence and mortality of hypertension and its complications6, so it is of great significance to establish a highly efficient and accurate risk prediction system for hypertension management.

Traditionally in medical practice, doctors usually evaluate the risk of a disease based on lifestyle and family history7,8. This approach is subject to subjective factors insufficient for the processing of large-scale complex medical data. By conducting in-depth analysis and modeling of medical data, potential risk factors for specific diseases can be identified and quantified, thus accurately and efficiently predicting the risk of related diseases9,10,11,12,13. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) technology as a powerful data analysis tool has been demonstrating huge potential in disease risk prediction. Zhang et al. used six different ML algorithms to predict the risk of type 2 diabetes in rural populations in China14. Mohammed et al. used ML techniques to analyze medical records and MRI images for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease15. Yan et al. have constructed a prediction system for diagnosing coronary heart disease based on ML technology, which can minimize unnecessary invasive examinations16. It can be seen that ML technology can predict the risk of hypertension by learning the patterns and rules in medical data. However, although ML technology has achieved excellent performance in disease prediction, due to its ""black box"" characteristics, the internal operation mechanism of the model is not transparent and it is difficult to explain the prediction results, which undermines the trust of doctors and patients in the predictive results and limits its application in clinical practice17,18.

To address this issue, this research developed a visualization risk prediction system for hypertension based on ML technology (Fig. 1). This system will use health check-up data in combination with ten different ML algorithms to accurately predict prehypertension and hypertension risk. At the same time, we use the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) algorithm to interpret the predictive results with a visually intuitive interface to present the results and evidence of the prediction. This visualization risk prediction system is efficient, accurate, convenient and can provide doctors and patients with more comprehensive hypertension risk assessment and management services, and it has broad clinical applicational prospects.","This study combined ML models and the SHAP algorithm to build a visualization risk prediction system for hypertension on the web. The LGB model demonstrated the highest accuracy, average F1-score, average AUC values, proving its superiority in hypertension classification prediction. This is possibly because LGB is a feature selection method based on gradient boosting trees, and traditional models like LR are more suitable for dealing with simple data where variables and results have a linear relationship, while deep learning models like BPNN are more suitable for processing image data or natural language problems42,43.

Compared to similar studies that only divide the population into two categories44, normotensive and hypertensive, our three-category study is more comprehensive and detailed, predicting the likelihood of prehypertension in individuals with normal blood pressure, which also aids in preventing the occurrence of hypertension and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, the AUC value of the ROC curve of the prediction model in this study is higher than that of similar studies (0.82 vs 0.77), showing better predictive performance45. Through the SHAP algorithm, we revealed the influence of different feature variables on the prediction results of hypertension. Age, ALP, triglycerides, and blood sugar are important prediction factors for hypertension. The increase in hypertension risk related to age is a result of the ageing process of the organ system46. Khalili et al. mentioned that ALP can catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphatase group in the vascular wall, leading to vascular calcification, damaging vascular homeostasis, and accelerating the development of hypertension47. Laaksonen et al. believe that lipoproteins rich in triglycerides are toxic to endothelial cells, long-term damage to endothelial cells may lead to increased peripheral vessel resistance, resulting in higher arterial blood pressure48. These research results have confirmed the reliability of SHAP algorithms in interpreting the outputs of ML models. These research findings indicate that the risk factors for hypertension obtained through the SHAP algorithm are reliable.

It is worth mentioning that this study builds the prediction system on a webpage, which is the first in the research of hypertension risk prediction based on machine learning technology, which helps to enhance the practicality and user-friendliness of the prediction system. Furthermore, after inputting individual's health examination data into the prediction system, the system can rank the importance by calculating the SHAP values of each feature, providing users with an intuitive explanation of individual disease risk. As shown in Fig. 6, we demonstrated the usage of the prediction system through examples. After entering information one by one or by importing files, the system show that the current blood pressure has reached prehypertension, and the risk probability of developing into hypertension is 56.5%. Features such as age, blood glucose, pressure, ALP, and Eosinophil Percentage etc. have a positive impact on the risk probability, and ALT and HbA1c have a negative impact on the risk probability. These interpretative results can provide important guidance for doctors and patients, helping them understand the key factors affecting hypertension risk and to devise more individualized prevention and intervention strategies accordingly.

While this research has made some progress in hypertension risk prediction and enhanced the interpretability of the model by introducing the SHAP algorithm, there still exist some limitations. First of all, although we have randomly divided the dataset, single data source may still affect the generalization ability of the prediction system. At the same time, as hypertension involves many complex biological and genetic factors, future work should consider adding information such as time factors, biomarkers, and genetic factors to the risk prediction system. Finally, the prediction system built on the web is accessible only on Windows, and further optimization is needed to accommodate different operating systems.

This research successfully built a visualization risk prediction system for hypertension, using ML models and the SHAP algorithm to improve the accuracy and interpretability of the system. Building the risk prediction model on a webpage is a major innovation of this study. It helps doctors and patients to more intuitively and conveniently understand the risk probability of hypertension and the main influencing factors, and to prevent and intervene hypertension in a targeted manner. All in all, the risk prediction system we developed is accurate, reliable, practical and can be used as an effective health management tool for hypertension."
10.1371/journal.pone.0299932,Thomas Mroz,2024,"Hypertension is a widely prevalent disease and uncontrolled hypertension predisposes affected individuals to severe adverse effects. Though the importance of controlling hypertension is clear, the multitude of therapeutic regimens and patient factors that affect the success of blood pressure control makes it difficult to predict the likelihood to predict whether a patient’s blood pressure will be controlled. This project endeavors to investigate whether machine learning can accurately predict the control of a patient’s hypertension within 12 months of a clinical encounter. To build the machine learning model, a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of 350,008 patients 18 years of age and older between January 1, 2015 and June 1, 2022 was performed to form model training and testing cohorts. The data included in the model included medication combinations, patient laboratory values, vital sign measurements, comorbidities, healthcare encounters, and demographic information. The mean age of the patient population was 65.6 years with 161,283 (46.1%) men and 275,001 (78.6%) white. A sliding time window of data was used to both prohibit data leakage from training sets to test sets and to maximize model performance. This sliding window resulted in using the study data to create 287 predictive models each using 2 years of training data and one week of testing data for a total study duration of five and a half years. Model performance was combined across all models. The primary outcome, prediction of blood pressure control within 12 months demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.76 (95% confidence interval; 0.75–0.76), sensitivity of 61.52% (61.0–62.03%), specificity of 75.69% (75.25–76.13%), positive predictive value of 67.75% (67.51–67.99%), and negative predictive value of 70.49% (70.32–70.66%). An AUC of 0.756 is considered to be moderately good for machine learning models. While the accuracy of this model is promising, it is impossible to state with certainty the clinical relevancy of any clinical support ML model without deploying it in a clinical setting and studying its impact on health outcomes. By also incorporating uncertainty analysis for every prediction, the authors believe that this approach offers the best-known solution to predicting hypertension control and that machine learning may be able to improve the accuracy of hypertension control predictions using patient information already available in the electronic health record. This method can serve as a foundation with further research to strengthen the model accuracy and to help determine clinical relevance.","The prevalence of hypertension, defined as blood pressure (BP, mmHg) ≥130 systolic or ≥ 80 diastolic, is estimated to be 116 million Americans and 1.3 billion people globally [1]. It remains the leading national and global cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death. In the U.S., hypertension is associated with 400,000 deaths per year, or about 1000 deaths per day, and worldwide the disease is attributed to 7.6 million deaths each year. Hypertensive patients are at approximately 2–4 times higher risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure [2]. The associated financial tolls are staggering. By 2035, it is estimated that cardiovascular disease will cost the U.S. annually in direct and indirect expense $1.1 trillion dollars, and hypertension will account for over $220 billion [3].

Less than one-third of the U.S. population with hypertension are controlled [4]. There are many reasons for poor BP control, including patient education, adherence to pharmacotherapy, and medication and dose selection. Computing capacity has increased exponentially over the past several decades, and types of artificial intelligence, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning have been applied to cardiovascular medicine. Both traditional regression-based methods [5–10] and ML [11–16] have been successfully used to predict incident hypertension, but no studies have applied ML to predict future control in hypertensive patients. The ability to predict control at any point in a patient’s care could shorten the time to control by triggering alternative approaches to care including medication and/or dose changes. The less time patients are hypertensive has been associated with lower cardiovascular and cerebral risk [17–22]. Therefore, quicker achievement of BP control could potentially diminish morbidity and mortality if an accurate prediction of control is coupled to a change in therapy.","The purpose of this study was to determine if ML could predict future BP control from a clinical encounter in hypertensive patients. It is well-known that controlling hypertension [23–28] and decreasing the time to control [17–22] is associated with diminished cardiovascular risk. It is logical to postulate that early prediction of BP control may improve time to control if the prediction prompts a change to more effective therapy. Machine learning [29–32] and deep learning [33–39] have emerged to show promise in the management of various cardiovascular diseases, and ML has been used to predict incident hypertension in a variety of scenarios [11–16]. However, there are no published reports of using ML to predict control in patients currently on hypertensive pharmacotherapy; therefore, this study that includes 350,008 patients and 10,564,174 clinical encounters is the first to do so.

Reducing time to BP control has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality [17–22]. The ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) study demonstrated that control in less than 6 months was associated with reduction in stroke, and prolonged hypertension was associated with higher incidence of heart failure and coronary artery disease [21]. The SCOPE (Study On Cognition and Prognosis in the Elderly) trial reported a lower incidence of fatal- and non-fatal stroke in patients who achieved control in less than 3 months [19]. In a post-hoc analysis, the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use of Evaluation (VALUE) trial reported a significant reduction of combined cardiac events, death, and stroke in patients achieving a systolic BP below 140 mm Hg within 6 months irrespective of treatment arm [22].

Our study is an early step toward using advanced computing to predict control. Through changes in therapy, this could improve the overall time to control. A key finding is that control prediction within 12 months from a clinical encounter has a reasonably high accuracy (0.756 AUC). Although the latter value usually indicates mediocre ML model performance, we believe that this AUC is promising considering the fluctuations in typical office BP measurements and data drift as described previously. As with any ML model with clinical applications, the only way to effectively evaluate its performance in terms of clinical relevancy is to deploy this clinical support tool in practice and study its impact on hypertension control. Current control was determined to be most predictive of future control when compared to over 800 included patient features. Table 1 shows that maximum systolic blood pressure values within the last 12 months were found to have nearly double the predictive importance when compared to maximum diastolic values. Similarly, the combination of chlorthalidone, metoprolol tartrate and spironolactone was nearly twice as predictive of control as the combination of carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, and spironolactone. This is not to suggest that the former is more effective than the latter; it simply quantifies the contribution to predictive accuracy when patients are prescribed those medications compared to when they are not.

An advantage of ML with large data repositories, and one deployed in this study, is trend analysis. A binary application of features (e.g., diabetes yes / no) to the control model is an oversimplification that would limit predictive accuracy. Moreover, it would not represent the dynamic interplay and influence that various features have with each other nor their absolute values and rate of change over time. Trends of various features and their influence on predictive accuracy were considered intentionally throughout this study. Among the many trends studied in this report, we found that rising, declining or stable trends of systolic pressure were the feature trends that most predict control, or lack thereof.

Gain was measured intentionally in this study and represents the boost to accuracy of a decision tree when that feature is present in the tree. Gain does not imply that a feature increases or decreases the probability of control. Feature importance can be used improve model interpretations and to suggest patient interventions that may improve outcomes. For example, several types of patient encounters are predictive of control such as the number of recent telephone calls between the hospital and patient. Further investigation may indicate that reaching out to patients for follow-up care may increase the number of patients who control their blood pressure. ML models, like this one, include hundreds and sometimes thousands of features and further investigation is required to define their importance to outcome. This will improve outcome interpretation relative to feature(s) and inform provider decisions to enhance care.

This main contribution of this study is the novel and successful application of ML to predict control from any encounter of hypertensive patients. A strength is the large number of included patients and clinical encounters, and the inclusion of all treating specialties (e.g., Cardiology, Internal Medicine, Family Medicine) which we think provides a “real-world” representation. However, this study has several notable limitations. One, the retrospective review of prospectively compiled institutional data is a fundamental study design limitation. However, given the number of included patients and encounters, a prospective study of this size would not be feasible. Two, this model will require prospective validation of the control predictions and external validation over various geographic hypertensive cohorts. A key to such validation will be to refine and confirm feature importance. Three, the lack of cause and effect clarity of feature importance is a current weakness of ML and this study because of the inability to completely define how certain features influence the prediction. While techniques such as Shapley values can help further define features [40], more research is necessary to understand mechanistic associations of features to outcome. An example is the varied feature importance across medications. This could indicate a phenotypic variation in response to anti-hypertensive medication as reflected by Sundstrom et al.’s recent publication [41]. As another example of feature importance, consider a hypertensive patient with 12-months rising creatinine, stable hemoglobin A1c, increasing BMI, downward trending ejection fraction, and prescribed both amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. In such a patient, the control model may indicate a 78% chance of control in nine months. Though, it will not inform why or how these features, their absolute values and rate of change, and their potential interplay with other features are causing or influencing blood pressure at specific timepoints. However, such modeling does permit predictions about control when such a patient is compared to thousands of other hypertensive patients. A fourth limitation is the lack of imaging analysis, such electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. Deep learning was not employed in this study but may offer opportunities to further strengthen hypertension control models. Despite these limitations, we believe this study can serve as a foundation to further develop capacity and define relevance of computing for the treatment of hypertensive patients."
 10.2196/52794,Hwang,2024,"Background
Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases are the primary cause of death, with hypertension as a key contributor. In 2019, cardiovascular diseases led to 17.9 million deaths, predicted to reach 23 million by 2030.

Objective
This study presents a new method to predict hypertension using demographic data, using 6 machine learning models for enhanced reliability and applicability. The goal is to harness artificial intelligence for early and accurate hypertension diagnosis across diverse populations.

Methods
Data from 2 national cohort studies, National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (South Korea, n=244,814), conducted between 2002 and 2013 were used to train and test machine learning models designed to anticipate incident hypertension within 5 years of a health checkup involving those aged ≥20 years, and Japanese Medical Data Center cohort (Japan, n=1,296,649) were used for extra validation. An ensemble from 6 diverse machine learning models was used to identify the 5 most salient features contributing to hypertension by presenting a feature importance analysis to confirm the contribution of each future.

Results
The Adaptive Boosting and logistic regression ensemble showed superior balanced accuracy (0.812, sensitivity 0.806, specificity 0.818, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.901). The 5 key hypertension indicators were age, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose. The Japanese Medical Data Center cohort dataset (extra validation set) corroborated these findings (balanced accuracy 0.741 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.824). The ensemble model was integrated into a public web portal for predicting hypertension onset based on health checkup data.

Conclusions
Comparative evaluation of our machine learning models against classical statistical models across 2 distinct studies emphasized the former’s enhanced stability, generalizability, and reproducibility in predicting hypertension onset.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with a staggering 17.9 million deaths recorded in 2019 [1]. This number is projected to rise to approximately 23 million by 2030. Of the multitude of CVDs, specific conditions such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke account for more than 85% of these CVD-related deaths [2]. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have highlighted that CVDs caused over US $216 billion in overall health care expenses and resulted in US $147 billion lost due to increased workplace absenteeism and corresponding productivity in the United States. As a result, CVDs impose a significant burden on the nation’s economy [3].

Given the acknowledged biological and economic risks associated with CVDs, it is widely recognized that hypertension plays a significant role in these health complications, including myocardial infarction and stroke [4]. Predicting hypertension onset is notably challenging due to the disease’s multifactorial origins, encompassing a wide range of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The subtle and often interrelated effects of these factors contribute to the complexity of early detection. For example, genetic predispositions may interact with lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and smoking habits, in ways that are not fully understood [5]. Environmental influences, including socioeconomic status and access to health care, further complicate the picture by affecting both the risk of developing hypertension and the ability to manage risk factors effectively [5,6]. Additionally, the asymptomatic nature of hypertension in its early stages means that it often goes unnoticed until more serious health issues arise, making timely and accurate prediction all the more difficult [7]. These challenges underscore the need for sophisticated predictive models that can integrate and analyze the myriad of contributing factors to identify individuals at risk of developing hypertension early in its progression. Considering the severe societal implications of hypertension across all nations, early diagnosis is crucial to mitigate its potential hazards. In this study, we propose a novel approach to predict the onset of hypertension using the population’s regular health checkup and demographic factors. In recent years, machine learning models have emerged as powerful tools across many fields, particularly in medical applications [8]. Their ability to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions has revolutionized how we approach health care challenges.

However, ensuring this methodology’s replicability and broad applicability in real-world settings presents an intricate challenge. To bolster the reliability of our hypertension projections, we conducted additional independent validation using distinct cohorts. This study investigated various machine learning approaches to strengthen the method’s robustness, replicability, and real-world practicality. We delved into the hypertension landscape across Asian populations through machine learning optics, firmly anchoring our methodology within the burgeoning realm of artificial intelligence (AI)–driven disciplines. This research endeavors to amplify our comprehension of global hypertension trends by channeling multifaceted machine learning analyses, thereby catalyzing more timely and precise diagnostic efforts.
","Main Findings
Given the significant health and economic consequences of CVDs, particularly myocardial infarction and stroke, it is essential to examine hypertension, a principal contributing factor to these conditions. This study uses data from 244,814 South Korean participants, obtained from the NHIS-NSC over a 12-year study period, and data from 1,296,649 Japanese participants, collected by the JMDC from various health insurance associations in Japan since 2005.

Our findings indicated that an ensemble of AdaBoost and LR models provided superior performance, achieving a sensitivity of 80.62%, specificity of 81.79%, balanced accuracy of 81.2%, and AUROC of 90.12%, suggesting that quantifying the occurrence of hypertension using feature importance analysis with ensemble machine learning (AdaBoost and LR) can enhance generalizability and reproducibility.

Using our knowledge of the machine learning model, our study has analyzed the occurrences of hypertension. Using feature importance analysis, our study has indicated the top 5-contribution features of hypertension, which were age, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose. Following the feature importance analysis, to measure the impact of such contributing features of hypertension, through an ablation study, we have excluded some contribution features among the top 5 contributing features of hypertension.

From our further investigation into the association between hypertension and independent variables, we analyzed various risk factors. Our analysis revealed that older age, female sex, urban residence, high income, elevated blood pressure, high serum total cholesterol, elevated hemoglobin, high AST, high γ-GTP, high BMI, history of diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, frequent alcohol intake, and insufficient physical activity were significantly associated with an increased risk of hypertension.

After obtaining test data results, through extra validation using the JMDC dataset, we have validated that our ensemble model combining AdaBoost and LR could provide an accurate prediction of hypertension within 5 years based on the regular health checkup data (balanced accuracy 0.741 and AUROC 0.824). Using such analysis of both the NHIS-NSC and JMDC as original and extra validation, our study has established a web application allowing diagnosis of hypertension [32-34].

Comparison With Previous Studies
Similar to our study, past research efforts have worked on developing hypertension risk prediction models using variables akin to our study, including age, sex, BMI, blood pressure metrics, parental hypertension history, smoking habits, and in certain cases, additional markers such as C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein A, and uric acid [35] (United States, n=1717 [36], n=1130 [37], n=15,732 [38], n=876 [39], and n=23,095 [40]; United Kingdom, n=10,308 [41]; and Iran, n=380 [42]).

Although there were several prior studies to find the occurrence of hypertension and establish web applications, many of these studies presented limitations, presenting problems such as producing low levels of reliability and yielding conflicting results. These constraints can be attributed to smaller sample sizes, short follow-up durations, and inadequate study designs such as nonrepresentative or nonrandom selection of populations [37,40,42]. Additionally, most of the studies have not held web application-fortifying processes, such as extra validation studies.

Our research stands apart in this context. We used a longitudinal approach using extensive datasets from both South Korean and Japanese health insurance databases, encompassing a comprehensive range of hypertension-related data spanning over 10 years. By leveraging datasets from 244,814 individuals in South Korea and 1,296,649 in Japan, we implemented a 5-fold cross-validation for optimizing an ensemble machine learning model. This was followed by a feature importance analysis to identify the top 5 determinants of hypertension, an ablation study to gauge the significance of each contributing factor, and an additional validation procedure. As a result, our work culminated in the development of a robust machine learning-powered web application, a milestone that many preceding studies fell short of achieving.

Possible Explanations for Our Results
This study harnesses real-world data where conventional statistical methods often struggle to guarantee generalizability and reproducibility in real-life situations. However, such challenges can be surmounted with AI-powered machine learning techniques such as variable pruning and group optimization.

By integrating machine learning methodologies, specifically AdaBoost and LR, our research can perpetually evaluate potential features linked to hypertension onset. This translates to a resilient system adept at observing the correlation between standardized traits and hypertension episodes, which include age, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose concentrations. Notably, this strategy offers considerable benefits, ensuring dependable data on hypertension prevalence across a wide demographic, even if the analysis encompasses merely a fraction of the overall populace. Additionally, our pioneering methodology offers a distinct advantage by ensuring accessibility even for individuals who may be illiterate or disinclined to participate in hypertension-specific screenings. This capacity for rapid diagnostic evaluation equips health care professionals with the tools to offer more targeted and accurate services to patients facing hypertension risks.

Policy Implication
Our diagnostic method’s validation, achieved via an ensemble machine learning strategy integrating AdaBoost and LR, consistently upholds accuracy in hypertension identification, even among newly discerned populations potentially susceptible to hypertension. This tool not only paves the way for preemptive hypertension identification but also extends its reach to individuals distant from conventional health care infrastructure, such as hospitals and regional health centers. Our study is keen on transitioning our web-based platform to a mobile app [18], addressing and eliminating any accessibility barriers. Such an evolution positions our tool as a universally accessible resource, irrespective of an individual’s socioeconomic status, domicile, or the developmental index of their nation. Worldwide, national administrations can advocate for our tool, empowering citizens to independently gauge their hypertension risk and pursue timely medical interventions. The distinct advantage of our platform is its avoidance of potential diplomatic sensitivities, given its nonreliance on any personal or confidential data.

Strengths and Limitations
An astute examination of this study’s findings calls for recognizing inherent limitations. To elaborate, even though our research draws on data from 2 distinct cohorts—the NHIS-NSC (n=244,814) for training or testing and the JMDC (n=1,296,649) for extra-validation—these datasets encompass but a marginal segment of the overarching Asian demographic, and an even lesser representation of the worldwide populace. This fact accentuates the imperative for our conclusions to be subjected to broader international validation studies and exhaustive longitudinal investigations. Furthermore, although the sample size of the JMDC is larger, its somewhat limited set of variables led us to develop a model using the comprehensive set of variables available in the NHIS-NSC [43]. Despite the smaller size of the NHIS-NSC, our proposed ensemble model showed stable and consistent performance when validated with the JMDC. Moreover, it is crucial to acknowledge that our study tested a limited array of model types, excluding machine learning models such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines. Including these models would have provided a comprehensive comparison and potentially strengthened our findings. Additionally, our analysis did not include certain hypertension-related features, such as family history, dietary habits, and salt consumption. As it is well known that these factors play a significant role in the development and progression of hypertension, their absence may have influenced the predictive power of the models and the holistic understanding of hypertension risk factors. Lastly, segmenting related variables such as systolic and diastolic pressure, ALT, and AST can capture diverse aspects and reduce data loss, but it may dilute significance due to their correlation [44].

While the primary aim of our study has been to identify predictors for the onset of hypertension, we acknowledge that predicting the magnitude of blood pressure increases offers an invaluable perspective on the complex interplay between initial blood pressure levels and their changes over time. This area, although not explored within the current scope of our research, holds significant potential for advancing our understanding of hypertension. Future investigations that include baseline blood pressure measurements could yield profound insights into the risk factors and dynamics of blood pressure changes. Such research would enrich our predictive models and refine management strategies for hypertension, marking a crucial step forward in the field.

Yet, amid these confines, one must not undermine this study’s significance. Our endeavor capitalizes on data meticulously gathered for over a decade from South Korea and Japan. In a methodical exercise of comparing a spectrum of 6 machine learning models and subsequently analyzing ensemble variations, we astutely pinpointed the critical determinants closely aligned with hypertension onset, ensuring commendable reproducibility and applicability. Furthermore, the genesis of a user-responsive web tool, facilitating individuals to input personal health metrics, epitomizes our groundbreaking stride toward expeditious, precision-driven, and worldwide accessible diagnostic avenues for hypertension."
10.1542/peds.2024-066675,Hengyan Liu,2025,"BACKGROUND
There has been a substantial burden of hypertension in children and adolescents. Given the availability of primary prevention strategies, it is important to determine predictors for early identification of children and adolescents at risk of hypertension. This study aims to attempt and validate machine learning (ML) algorithms for accurately predicting blood pressure (BP) status (normal, prehypertension, and hypertension) over 1- and 3-year periods, identifying key predictors without compromising model performance.

METHODS
We included a population-based cohort of primary 1 to secondary 6 students (typically aged 6 to 18 years) during the academic years of 1995 to 1996 and 2019 to 2020 in Hong Kong. Thirty-six easy-assessed predictors were initially model childhood BP status. Multiple ML algorithms, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and multinomial logistic regression (MLR), were used. Model evaluation was performed by various accuracy metrics. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used to identify key features for both predictions.

RESULTS
A total of 923 301 and 602 179 visit pairs were used for the 1- and 3-year predictions, respectively. XGBoost demonstrated the highest prediction accuracies for 1-year (macro–area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.92, micro-AUROC = 0.91) and 3-year (macro-AUROC = 0.91, micro-AUROC = 0.90) periods. The traditional MLR approach had the lowest accuracies for 1- (macro-AUROC = 0.70, micro-AUROC = 0.68) and 3-year (macro-AUROC = 0.70, micro-AUROC = 0.68) predictions. The SHAP values identified 17 key predictors without the need for direct BP measurements or laboratory tests.

CONCLUSION
ML prediction models can accurately predict childhood prehypertension and hypertension at 1 and 3 years, independent of BP and laboratory measurements. The identified key predictors may inform areas for personalized prevention in hypertension.","Childhood hypertension and prehypertension pose significant health concerns,1–3 even when blood pressure (BP) levels fall within the high to normal range.4–6 These conditions lead to long-term hypertension-related complications and economic burdens later in life.3,7–9 The pooled prevalence of childhood hypertension and prehypertension has been estimated at approximately 4% and 10%, respectively.10,11 Primordial lifestyle-based preventions that prevent the development of risk factors of hypertension early in childhood, such as increased physical activity and healthier eating habits, can lower BP levels and improve long-term clinical outcomes and quality of life.12–14 Additionally, primary prevention strategies that focus on at-risk individuals (ie, those with manifested risk factors) may be more effective.13,15,16 Therefore, the early identification of at-risk children and adolescents presents an opportune time for implementing targeted lifestyle modifications and other preventive strategies before the condition fully develops.

Despite the importance of early prevention, there is a lack of predictive models for childhood hypertension in the general pediatric population.17,18 Existing studies primarily focus on cross-sectional classification, yielding modest performance.19,20 Although studies using anthropometric, biochemical, or gene expression predictors have achieved higher accuracies, these were only tested in small samples.21–23 Few studies have examined temporal prediction of childhood hypertension, and those that have relied heavily on BP measurements and laboratory tests,24,25 which are challenging to obtain, especially in obese children.25,26 Moreover, there is a pervasive lack of awareness among health care providers and parents regarding the importance of annual BP screening in this population.16,27,28 To address these gaps, this study aims to employ machine learning (ML) techniques to predict 1- and 3-year BP status, including normal, prehypertension, and hypertension, using a population-based cohort of Hong Kong children and adolescents. Our goal is to identify important predictors without relying on BP measurements and laboratory tests, providing a user-friendly tool to facilitate early identification of high-risk children and guide targeted prevention strategies, enhancing parental awareness, and aiding clinical professionals in implementing appropriate preventions.","This retrospective study developed the first ML models to temporally predict 1- and 3-year BP status in Hong Kong children and adolescents. Our models demonstrate high accuracies without the need for direct BP measurements and laboratory tests. By using SHAP values, we identified 17 easily assessed predictors for both prediction periods, offering practical insights for timely advice to individuals at risk of developing prehypertension and hypertension.

Sex, weight, and age were identified as the most important predictors for both 1- and 3-year predictions. Among these, weight stands out as the only modifiable and easy-to-measure factor. Higher body weight increases the risk of hypertension, underscoring the need for vigilance among pediatricians and parents. Individuals classified as overweight or obese, along with those nearing overweight status, should take regular and accurate BP measurements.

Dietary and physical activity habits emerged as pivotal predictors, highlighting key lifestyle aspects influencing childhood prehypertension and hypertension risk. Our findings reinforced previous clinical recommendations for increased aerobic exercise, reduced sedentary behavior, and improved nutrition.40 In particular, more hours of aerobic exercise and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables were associated with lower prehypertension or hypertension risk over both short- and long-term periods. Therefore, we strongly advocate for health management programs for students, particularly those with abnormal weight. In Hong Kong, initiatives like EatSmart@school.hk and StartSmart@school.hk have been launched in school settings to promote healthy eating and physical activity among primary and secondary students.41–43 It is also advisable for parents and caregivers to actively engage in health education activities to understand recommended weight ranges and nutrition strategies.43 

Socioeconomic status (SES) also emerged as a significant predictor of childhood hypertension. Previous studies reported varied correlations between SES and BP, often due to differing SES indicators used.44,45 Our study adopted multiple SES indicators, including parental education levels, mother’s occupation, and housing type, revealing that very low SES would result in higher risk of hypertension in children and adolescents. In general, the relationship between SES and BP is complex44,45; lower childhood SES has been linked with diminished nocturnal BP, known as nocturnal nondipping, potentially increasing cardiovascular disease risk in later life.46 Protective factors such as parental education and income may mitigate adverse health outcomes associated with low SES neighborhoods.45 House type reflects the living environment stressors, including noise and overcrowding, which may in turn influence primary hypertension and related health outcomes for children and adolescents.47 Although it may be challenging to promptly alter SES factors, our study highlights the significance of garnering attention from public health researchers, parents, and policymakers who are concerned with housing conditions.

Most interestingly, parent-related self-esteem, social self-esteem, and emotional behavior were identified as important predictors of hypertension for the first time. Children and adolescents grappling with emotional problems and low self-esteem issues may be more prone to developing disordered eating habits and negative self-awareness.48 This susceptibility can, in turn, lead to increased food consumption and reduced physical activity and, subsequently, weight-related problems, thus elevating prehypertension and hypertension.48–50 Previous research emphasized the role of parental support and a friendly social environment in promoting healthy development and preventing childhood obesity.51,52 Consequently, our findings suggest that health promotion strategies should adopt a comprehensive approach to prevention and intervention. Efforts should address the consequences of social and emotional factors on health outcomes and be implemented early in the life course.

Our study was conducted in Hong Kong, a region with a high prevalence and underrecognition of hypertension, affecting not only adults but also school-aged children and adolescents. For instance, 4.9% of youth aged 15 to 24 years are hypertensive, with approximately 41% of the noninstitutionalized population aged 15 years and older unaware of their condition.53,54 Hong Kong presents a unique developed and non-Western region that has experienced rapid socioeconomic development and changes over the past decades.55,56 Its distinct living and housing conditions, including high residential population density, small living spaces, and a significant proportion of foreign domestic helpers,57–59 significantly influence the lifestyles and health indicators of children and adolescents.55,57,59 We focused on children and adolescents in primary and secondary schools, using a territory-wide dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of the predictors of childhood primary hypertension predictors. However, the relatively homogeneous Han Chinese population in Hong Kong, accounting for approximately 95.0% to 91.6% from 2006 to 2021,60 may limit the generalizability of our findings to more diverse regions.

The improved prediction performance by the ML algorithms can be attributed to their ability to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships among predictors.61 XGBoost, in particular, employs effective regularization techniques that prevent overfitting, enhancing generalization to unseen data.61 Its wide range of tunable hyperparameters allows for further optimization of predictive performance.61 The gradient boosting framework iteratively adds decision trees to correct errors from previous ones, contributing to higher prediction accuracy compared with alternative ML models considered in this study.62 XGBoost’s computational efficiency, particularly through parallel computing, positions it as an effective tool for clinical predictions.30 Although the effectiveness and its excellent performance have been demonstrated in various predictive tasks, such as acute heart failure,63 stroke risk,64 and air pollution,65 its transferability to other applications remains uncertain.66 Therefore, we attempted multiple ML approaches to ensure we would not have obtained suboptimal results.

Limitations
There are several limitations to consider. First, the data collected by the SHS may not capture all relevant variables that could influence hypertension risk. Factors, such as family history of hypertension, exposure to secondhand smoking, and sleep issues, that are known to be associated with childhood primary hypertension should be considered in future studies. Second, although we employed SMOTE to address class imbalance, it is important to note that this method can potentially lead to overfitting because the synthetic samples generated may not accurately represent real-world variability or the underlying population, which could affect the precision metric, particularly if the prevalence of the minority classes is artificially altered. Additionally, our prediction models have not been validated in an external dataset. Assessing the prediction accuracy of our derived models in an independent dataset would be desirable to confirm their generalizability. Third, we did not extensively investigate the specific effect sizes of individual predictors, focusing instead on predictive power and summarized importance ranking. Further research is needed to explore and explain the detailed effects of individual predictors, considering potential interrelationships and confounding effects among variables."
10.1371/journal.pone.0240370,Latifa A AlKaabi,2020,"Background and objective: Hypertension, a global burden, is associated with several risk factors and can be treated by lifestyle modifications and medications. Prediction and early diagnosis is important to prevent related health complications. The objective is to construct and compare predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using 987 records of Qataris and long-term residents aged 18+ years from Qatar Biobank. Percentages were used to summarize data and chi-square tests to assess associations. Predictive models of hypertension were constructed and compared using three supervised machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and logistics regression using 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of algorithms was assessed using accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Stata and Weka were used for analysis.

Results: Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother's history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. All algorithms showed more or less similar performances: Random forest (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.4%, sensitivity = 82.1%), logistic regression (accuracy = 81.1%, PPV = 80.1%, sensitivity = 81.1%) and decision tree (accuracy = 82.1%, PPV = 81.2%, sensitivity = 82.1%. In terms of AUC, compared to logistic regression, while random forest performed similarly, decision tree had a significantly lower discrimination ability (p-value<0.05) with AUC's equal to 85.0, 86.9, and 79.9, respectively.

Conclusions: Machine learning provides the chance of having a rapid predictive model using non-invasive predictors to screen for hypertension. Future research should consider improving the predictive accuracy of models in larger general populations, including more important predictors and using a variety of algorithms.","Hypertension is a common health condition that has become an issue in the modern world; it is part of the metabolic syndrome and a multifactorial condition in which an individual is diagnosed with systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/ or a diastolic pressure ≥90 mmHg. Its exact causes are unknown but genetic mutation, increased sodium intake, decreased physical activity, and obesity contribute to its progression [1]. In some cases, hypertension acts as a “silent killer;” only noticed when it reaches a dangerous level [2].

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hypertension globally contributes to 12.8% of the total deaths, and approximately causes 7.5 million deaths [3]. The STEPwise survey conducted in Qatar in 2012 showed that 32.9% of the population aged 18–64 years were hypertensive or on medication for hypertension; 28.0% of females and 37.7% males, while 31.4% were not on medication for hypertension [4].

For some people, hypertension treatment may include only lifestyle adjustments without the use of medications. Intervening into lifestyle includes, but not limited to, reducing salt intake, adopting a low-fat diet, consuming more fruits and vegetables, adopting an active lifestyle, and quitting smoking [1]. One successful prevention approach is to specify those at high risk and target them. Research has shown that the development of hypertension is not only influenced by prehypertension status, but also by other factors such as age [5], gender [6], diet [7], body mass index [8], literacy level [9], stress [10], comorbidities [11] as well as clinical parameters [12–15].

Due to the huge costs of chronic diseases, studies were conducted to estimate the risk of hypertension, to prevent further costly management and treatment of complications. Conventional logistic regression was applied in many of these studies.

Predictive models are useful in predicting hypertension, being essential in medical practice because of their value in patients’ care [16]. Used in clinical settings, the Framingham hypertension risk score, a gender-specific algorithm, is used to predict the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in 10-year time [17]. It is one of the main scores used to indicate hypertension. Many methods utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques are used in risk models of hypertension, e.g., artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest, naive bayes classifier, gradient boosting machines, decision tree, and logistic regression [18–20]. Echouffo-Tcheugui et al. systematical reviewed the performance of such algorithms [20], and Krittanawong et al. gave a comprehensive review on the prediction of hypertension using artificial intelligence [19].

Using several ML techniques, a number of predictive factors were identified to predict hypertension, e.g., comorbidity, medication history, age >60 years, sex, smoking, family history of hypertension, body mass index, educational level, salty diet, vegetable, fruit and meat consumption, regular physical exercise, low-density lipids, occupational status, depression and anxiety status [21–24].

According to the American Heart Association, hypertension, obesity and ageing are the leading risk factors to cardiovascular diseases, costing the USA’s health system, around $555 billion in 2016, which is estimated to double to $1.1 trillion in 2035 [25]. On the other hand, the costs per episode of care for hypertension in low and middle-income countries ranges between $500 and $1500 or monthly costs of treatment around $22 [26]. Additionally, people often develop hypertension in their middle age, which leads to a loss in productive years, incurring the healthcare system more expenses [27]. Limited data is available on the economic burden of hypertension in Qatar. Early identification of hypertensive patients will contribute to reducing the cost and economic burdens of hypertension on any healthcare system. These individuals at high risk may be identified using predictive models based on baseline data easily obtained from non-intrusive procedures. Such individuals may be sent to health facilities for preventive measures. Besides serving as a pilot for future studies, the contribution of this study to human knowledge is important in terms of applying new methods to diagnose individuals with hypertension easily and, most importantly, without unnecessary extra expenditures or resources that can be utilized elsewhere.

The objective of this study was to construct and compare logistic regression predictive models and decision tree techniques, using ML, to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension without the need of invasive clinical procedures.

","As healthcare expenditures increase on chronic diseases with the increase in population, the significance of the application of this study in the public health field cannot be underestimated as the main goal of the predictive model is to predict the occurrence of hypertension. Consequently, such advancements facilitate forecasting trends. Implications of this study make it easier for the health workforce to identify individuals at high risk and those eligible for screening. Gaining such information on predicting hypertension will not only result in being advantageous to the individual by preventing adverse complications but also to the departmental and organizational levels decision-makers as it can facilitate in strategic decision making on certain areas of the healthcare system. Health professionals and policymakers can utilize the decision tree as a guide in establishing new programs by intervening or undergoing some corrective actions on existing ones and in understanding the most efficient method of resource allocation according to the number of individuals at risk in a region or per healthcare organization. In this research, models were developed to predict the occurrence of hypertension based on the presence of several predictors. This study assessed the ability of three ML algorithms to make these predictions based on non-intrusive baseline information. Age, gender, education level, employment, tobacco use, physical activity, adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, abdominal obesity, history of diabetes, history of high cholesterol, and mother’s history high blood pressure were important predictors of hypertension. Algorithms generally had good prediction accuracy with random forest having better discrimination ability outperforming logistic regression and decision tree algorithms.

Predictive models using ML can generate robust diagnostic parameters as they produce accurate predictions using relationships between data, which verify its incremental validity [24]. For example, predictions of hypertension using conventional logistic regression are not further validated. However, when using ML, predictive logistic regression predicts the risk of hypertension by ""learning"" from data and validating the prediction. Furthermore, ML can substantiate which variable or set of variables is the most pragmatic in predicting hypertension. For expertise in this field, ML used in predictive models enables them to analyze and interpret clinical parameters identified as predictors for hypertension or not, along with other variables like daily lifestyle and other biological indicators [51]. Predictive models are constantly customized as prevention strategies as they are developed to tailor the intensity of the preventive measures to those at high risk of developing hypertension [16]. Moreover, they help in risk communication as they facilitate reaching out for those at high risk of developing hypertension and selecting them for clinical intervention, and lastly, allocate resources for future hypertension burdens.

Similar to our study, the medical literature identified certain biometric data such as age, obesity, and physical activity to be used in predicting hypertension [24, 44]. Consistent with other studies, our results revealed that older people are more vulnerable to develop the disease. One study found that older people are at a 2.7 times higher risk than younger ones to develop hypertension. This is manifested through the mechanism of the stiffening of the aorta and artery walls due to increased pulsatile stress that accelerates elastin degradation [5]. Longevity interventions and lifestyle factors are expected to improve cardiovascular fitness among the elderly [52]. Other studies reported that participants with metabolic syndrome have a higher likelihood of developing hypertension; diabetic participants and those with a history of high cholesterol are three times more likely to have hypertension compared with those who are not [53]. These results are concordant with our study.

Validated clinical studies identified the correlation between waist circumference and not having normal blood pressure [54, 55]; our findings are in agreement with these studies. Participants with higher waist circumference have a greater likelihood of developing hypertension by almost ten times than participants with normal waist circumference. This is due to the central accumulation of adipose tissues that are associated with elevated levels of triglycerides and uric acid, which are essential components of high blood pressure along with other components related to metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance [55].

Our study found that hypertension was more prevalent in males than females; this is similar to other studies [56]. According to a study conducted by Zekewos in 2019, the possible reason behind the gender disparity in hypertension prevalence is due to biological distinction and behavioral risk factors like physical activity, alcohol consumption, or smoking [6]. Being a woman with less addiction to smoking and alcohol than men is considered protective. Furthermore, women are known to be more involved and investing in the utilization of healthcare services regularly, which makes them more likely to achieve better health outcomes than men [6]. However, in this study, although hypertension was more prevalent in males than females, the difference was not statistically significant. This might be due to the unique demographic composition in Qatar. The labor force, which is mostly males, depart the country before retiring at the age of 60 years. As people develop hypertension in older ages, the country remains with younger males and, therefore with a lower count of males with hypertension.

Other hypertension risk factors like alcohol consumption, kidney disease, and salt consumption were not included in our study. Qatar is an Islamic country where consumption of alcohol is forbidden, and the sale of alcohol is limited due to the religious rulings [57]. Therefore, such data was not collected. Chronic kidney disease was also not evaluated because only 6 subjects in our sample suffered from this disease. Studies have shown that the reduction of salt consumption prevents hypertension [58]. We were not able to assess this association in this study due to data limitations.

In the current study, a ""healthy volunteer"" selection bias was present due to the underrepresentation of the study sample to the general population of Qatar. QBB participants are recruited either via social media, through the QBB website, or by personal recommendations of family and friends [30]. In our study, most participants were Qataris (85%); 12% were long term Arab residents, and 3% were long-term non-Arab residents [30]. On the contrary, only 15% of the general population are Qataris [59]; as such other characteristics like employment and history of diseases vary. Sample size, inclusion, and selection of participants will have an overall effect on the performance of the algorithms due to the common issue of underestimation that was faced in previous studies that have utilized ML. Although the sample is not representative of the population in Qatar, it would have been adequate for generalization of results and proper assessment of the performance of the algorithms if our study had a larger sample size [60, 61].

Logistic regression showed better discrimination ability than the decision tree in terms of predicting the risk of hypertension because minimal changes and variability in the data can create high instability in decision trees [62]. This was inconsistent with previous studies [63]. Discrepancies in classification models’ performance are related to several factors, including the differences in technologies, procedures, and assumptions that operate under each model, differences in the dataset characteristics, and the number of predictors used as well as the model building technique and sample size [64]. Similar to performance results found in some studies [65, 66], random forest performed better than the decision tree. This result is expected, as random forests with multiple single trees are known to be robust techniques than a single decision tree. Random forest considers the outputs of multiple decision trees, which addresses their sensitivity to the training data resulting in a reduction in the variance within the outcome of the data [47]. In our study, logistic regression and random forest were comparable in their discrimination ability. This result is consistent with other simulation studies with sample sizes of less than 1,000 observations [67]. Random forest will outperform logistic regression when there are nonlinearities and interactions among predictors. It is potential that in our hypertension prediction model, predictors related additively in a linear fashion similar to other clinical predictor models, thus defying the superiority of random forest [68, 69].

This study provides a foundation for the prediction of hypertension depending on a number of risk factors. Most of the predictor variables used in this study were in line with other published data [6, 23, 51]. The strength of this study is the focus on non-invasive data and exploring more than one algorithm to predict hypertension.

Nonetheless, this study has some limitations. First, the prediction algorithms used in this study were applied to relatively small sample size. The augmented data in our study had a sample size of 1,128 with 282 hypertensive events. Using five-fold cross-validation means that the observations used to train the models amount to 902 (= 1128*0.8) with 225 (= 902*282/1128) hypertensive events. For logistic regression, the minimum training data size is determined by the number of events rather than the number of observations with 10 events per variable as a general rule of thumb [70]. Since we have 11 variables in our logistic model, the minimal number of events is 10*11 = 110, which is beyond our 225 number of events. In general, the algorithm used in this study performs better using larger sample sizes [63], particularly those based on decision trees. Compared to logistic regression, these algorithms may need 10 times as many events for each predictor to achieve a small amount of overfitting [71]. Thus results of this study should be interpreted with caution.

Second, our results were from a single, cross-sectional sample to predict hypertension using a number of predictors, and these predictors may change over time; any causal associations between predictors and hypertension is thus limited. Finally, the study population did not represent the population of Qatar in terms of age, nationality, and other characteristics. The QBB study, from which the data of this study was extracted, collects records from healthy volunteers, which introduced selection bias, therefore, limiting the generalizability of the results external to the QBB population, particularly with our limited sample size."
10.1016/j.pmedr.2024.102806,Anders Norrman,2024,"Background: Many individuals with hypertension remain undiagnosed. We aimed to develop a predictive model for hypertension using diagnostic codes from prevailing electronic medical records in Swedish primary care.

Methods: This sex- and age-matched case-control (1:5) study included patients aged 30-65 years living in the Stockholm Region, Sweden, with a newly recorded diagnosis of hypertension during 2010-19 (cases) and individuals without a recorded hypertension diagnosis during 2010-19 (controls), in total 507,618 individuals. Patients with diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases or diabetes were excluded. A stochastic gradient boosting machine learning model was constructed using the 1,309 most registered ICD-10 codes from primary care for three years prior the hypertension diagnosis.

Results: The model showed an area under the curve (95 % confidence interval) of 0.748 (0.742-0.753) for females and 0.745 (0.740-0.751) for males for predicting diagnosis of hypertension within three years. The sensitivity was 63 % and 68 %, and the specificity 76 % and 73 %, for females and males, respectively. The 25 diagnoses that contributed the most to the model for females and males all exhibited a normalized relative influence >1 %. The codes contributing most to the model, all with an odds ratio of marginal effects >1 for both sexes, were dyslipidaemia, obesity, and encountering health services in other circumstances.

Conclusions: This machine learning model, using prevailing recorded diagnoses within primary health care, may contribute to the identification of patients at risk of unrecognized hypertension. The added value of this predictive model beyond information of blood pressure warrants further study.","Hypertension is of major global health concern with a prevalence of 35–50 % in the adult population and a significant contribution to morbidity and mortality (Zhou et al., 2021).

A major issue is that about half of the individuals with hypertension are unrecognized (Zhou et al., 2021). This emphasizes the need for better screening to offer proper management and to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular disease and mortality (Mancia et al., 2023). Since few countries have the resources to offer population based systematic blood pressure screening, opportunistic screening during health care visits is recommended, at least among people with a higher likelihood of elevated blood pressure (Mancia et al., 2023).

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to improve the detection of hypertension (Chaikijurajai et al., 2020, Tsoi et al., 2021). However, limited evidence exists for its clinical use, and further research is necessary before implementation in health care (Padmanabhan et al., 2021). A recent review aimed to assess the use of machine learning, a type of AI, in predicting hypertension, and highlighted the potential benefits of using AI in predicting hypertension (Silva et al., 2022). Thus, AI-based methods may have the potential to identify additional, previously unknown, factors from the routine data collected by primary care centres, which could help identify individuals at higher risk of hypertension (Silva et al., 2022). The majority of patients with hypertension are identified and monitored through primary care centres; therefore, data from these centres are ideal to study the clinical practice of hypertension (Hasselström et al., 2014).

Our study aimed to utilize machine learning to develop predictive models for diagnosis of hypertension within three years by analysing the diagnostic codes recorded in primary care electronic medical records. The analyses were stratified by sex as there are diverging risk factors and different patterns of diagnosis in males and females (Carlsson et al., 2008, Gerdts et al., 2022).","This study applied an SGB model to predict whether an individual had hypertension or not, based on data on previous recorded diagnostic codes in primary care electronic medical records from the three years preceding a registered diagnosis of hypertension. In individuals 30–65 years old with no known major cardiovascular disease or diabetes, the model showed a modest sensitivity and specificity of 63 % and 76 % in females, and 68 % and 73 % in males, respectively. The diagnostic codes contributing the most to the model irrespective of sex, with the highest NRI were “dyslipidaemia”, “obesity”, and “encounters with health services in other circumstances”, where “encounter for issue of repeat prescription” is the most common subcode.

4.1. Results in perspective
The results of this study demonstrate an association between several diagnostic codes and recorded diagnosis of hypertension within three years, aligned with previous research and AI models. Specifically, overweight or obesity (Kanegae et al., 2020, Liao et al., 2022), high fasting glucose (Kanegae et al., 2020, Liao et al., 2022), dyslipidaemia (Sakr et al., 2018, Ye et al., 2018), previously higher blood pressures (Kanegae et al., 2020, Sakr et al., 2018), coronary heart disease (Ye et al., 2018), multiple chronic diseases (Ye et al., 2018) and psychiatric diseases (Ye et al., 2018) all exhibit a strong association in this model. The results in this study are in accordance with the well-established association with risk factors within the metabolic syndrome, where high blood pressure occurs alongside with glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidaemia, abdominal obesity, and microalbuminuria (Carlsson et al., 2009). Previous studies developed AI models to detect high blood pressure in undiagnosed patients, but only a few were conducted specifically within primary care settings (Silva et al., 2022).

Other diagnoses that predict hypertension are those indicating that the patient has visited health care for any reason, for example renewal of prescription. Common diagnoses in primary care of various types, such as “Other and unspecified soft tissue disorders” (including myalgia (Wändell et al., 2013) and dorsalgia (Wändell et al., 2013), and acute respiratory tract infections (Wändell et al., 2013), also had ORME:s >1 for both females and males. The most likely explanation for these results is that the likelihood of having hypertension detected increases in individuals with many visits to primary care centres and that individuals with these diagnoses visit primary care centres more.

Values for sensitivity, specificity, and AUC ROC in the prediction model used in this study show modest results. Previous prediction models have relied on blood pressure measurements (Sheppard et al., 2016). Previous studies with access to blood pressure measurements have AUC ROC between 0.766 and 1.00 (Ford et al., 2013, Silva et al., 2022). This study, however, is based on receiving a diagnosis of hypertension in the electronic medical records and adds new complementary information. In this study, we demonstrate that prediction of diagnosis of hypertension within three years in possible based solely on previously recorded diagnoses without the need for collecting other clinical information.

4.2. Strengths and limitations
One strength of this study was the inclusion of all new cases of a recorded diagnosis of hypertension in Region Stockholm during the study period, providing a detailed dataset of previously registered diagnoses for machine learning analysis. Conducting the study in a real-world primary care setting, where more than 50 % of all healthcare encounters take place (Wändell et al., 2013) enhances the external validity of the findings and their applicability to clinical practice. Another strength is that we excluded patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes for three years (2010–2013) prior to finding diagnosis of hypertension within three years (2014–2019). Yet, these diagnoses occurred as risk factors if they presented before the hypertension diagnosis during the study period.

A weakness of the study design is that the model depends only on previous diagnoses registered by the general practitioner. Previous studies have highlighted that general practitioners may not document all symptom diagnoses presented during consultations (Ford et al., 2013), and the registration of diagnoses may vary over time. In addition, registration of related diseases like obesity, dyslipidaemia, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral arterial disease are known to be limited in primary care in Sweden (Wändell et al., 2013). Given the known low detection rate of hypertension it is likely that several controls have undetected hypertension. Further, ethnicity, which plays a significant role in the prevalence of hypertension, could not be included, as data on ethnicity are not registered in the clinical setting (Carlsson et al., 2008).

Relying solely on diagnosed hypertension rather than actual blood pressure values introduces uncertainty regarding the results, as patients with elevated blood pressure readings where diagnoses have not been made are not classified as cases. A sensitivity analysis for the number of visits was not performed and we cannot determine whether the NRI for certain diagnoses is linked to the diagnosis itself or to the fact that the patient has visited the primary care and received a diagnosis. Additionally, the model has a weakness in its clinical utility in that patients without previous visits have not been included in the model.

Machine learning techniques such as SGB do not make any distributional assumptions about the underlying data (Chen and Guestrin, 2016). However, risks can arise from the environmental constraints set during the design of the study, such as the age limit of 65 years, which may exert an influence and limit the generalizability of the results. One strength lies in the algorithm's consistent interpretation of diagnoses once they have been established. However, there is a risk that bias in the initial assignment of diagnoses may influence the reliability of the model.

4.3 Clinical implications
International guidelines recommend that people at high risk of having elevated blood pressure should be offered opportunistic screening for hypertension in relation to health care visits, and patients with established hypertension should have their blood pressure controlled at least annually (Mancia et al., 2023). Swedish recommendations align with these guidelines. In Sweden, most adults visit primary care, for various reasons, at least once every year. Although this would offer an excellent chance for opportunistic screening, blood pressure is not routinely measured at primary care visits in Swedish primary care. Further, a recent Swedish study on the time required to follow guidelines for the management of hypertension suggests that there is room for improvement (Johansson et al., 2023). We postulate that the modelling approach used in our machine learning model could assist clinicians in flagging patients at-risk for hypertension and ensure that a blood pressure check is offered by the care giver. This may help optimize resource and time utilization, and eventually increase the number of patients with previously undetected hypertension being offered appropriate treatment.

Further studies could include additional variables or qualitatively assessing how stakeholders in primary care perceive the model (Terry et al., 2022). Additional studies targeting older individuals are also warranted."
